You've already dipped your toes into the water and exploited a couple of Solana smart contracts. Now it's time to fully jump in and exploit Solana itself! This challenge is based on a real vulnerability we found and reported last year. Your goal again is to call the flag contract with proof that you have flag tokens. But there is a catch this time: we didn't mint any flag tokens!

If you enjoy this challenge, make sure to check out the Solana Bug Bounty program. The bounties are very generous, paid out every month and the folks over at Solana are great to work with.
