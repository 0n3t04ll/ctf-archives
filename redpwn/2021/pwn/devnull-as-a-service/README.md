You've heard of /dev/null as a service; now get ready for /dev/null as a service, enterprise edition! Our custom proprietary glibc (don't sue us) guarantees that your data will be securely lost with no chance of being stolen or leaked, 100% of the time.

You can send your shells to /tmp/stdout; see run for more info. This challenge has a large POW to discourage brute force. Please play nice! Test locally and don't try to circumvent the POW.
