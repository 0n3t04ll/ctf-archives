Author's note: our version of stockfish is a neural net. The stockfish binary and nn.nnue files must be present in the same directory as the chal binary for the script to run locally.

Update: There is a bug that occurs when the CPU attempts to castle, it deletes some pieces. This bug does not affect the intended solution for the challenge.
