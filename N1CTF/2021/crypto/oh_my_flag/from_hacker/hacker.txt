Dear Lyutoon,
  I hacked your PC and found serveral MISC challenges in it. Are they for N1CTF 2021? I guess there is not enough challs for N1CTF 2021,so you make such fxxking EZ challs only as stopgap???
TBH,I hate boring MISC.Let's make it more interesting.LMAO.
  # ./encryptor enc orig.bmp orig_hacked.bmp secret
  # ./encryptor enc final.bmp final_hacked.bmp secret
  # rm -rf orig.bmp final.bmp secret
U must transfer 100 BTC to me in 3 days,or your secret key for your n1ctf chall will be * DELETED PERMANENTLY *.
I used the most advanced cryptography technique, so DO NOT brute force the key or ask for help. Just give me money :-).
