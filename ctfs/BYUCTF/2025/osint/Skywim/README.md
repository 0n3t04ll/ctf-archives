One time I tried to take a screenshot of my Skyrim character next to my favorite NPC (who doesnâ€™t love goth girls). I decided to AFK for a second to heat up some soup. Unfortunately, there were some unexpected enemies up here, and I died. My last save was like 4 hours before this picture was taken, and I never remembered where I captured this beautiful sight. Can you help me find the name of the location where this picture was taken in Skyrim?

This is a real, named location in Skyrim. You do not need to own or play the game to solve this challenge, though it could be helpful.
