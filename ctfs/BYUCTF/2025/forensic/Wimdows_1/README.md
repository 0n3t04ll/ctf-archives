Earlier this week, an attacker managed to get into one of our Windows servers... can you help us figure out what happened? The VM files for this challenge are located below (the credentials are vagrant/vagrant):

What CVE did the attacker exploit to get a shell on the machine? Wrap your answer in byuctf{}. E.g. byuctf{CVE-2021-38759}

Hint: Figure out what process the attacker exploited and look up vulnerabilities associated with it.
