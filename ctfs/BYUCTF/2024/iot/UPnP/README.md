Forensics Misc

I found that my router has a UPnP service exposed on port 52881 and started interacting with it. Using some basic enumeration tools, I retrieved a list of UPnP actions. The only one that I was able to actually get anything back from is GetDeviceInfo, but I can't make any sense of it... can you?

What's the base64-encoded nonce value?

Flag format - byuctf{base64value}
