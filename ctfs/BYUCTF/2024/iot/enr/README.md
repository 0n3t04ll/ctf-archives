Rev Forensics Mobile Crypto

I just moved into a new apartment that came prefurnished with a Vilo router. To set up the router, I downloaded Vilo's app from the App Store and connected to my router. However, I'm a naturally curious person so I wanted to see what data my app was sending the router, and figured out how to capture traffic going to the router. Unfortunately, it seems some messages are encrypted, so I'm hoping the APK file will shed some light on this.

What's the non-null enr value being sent to the router?
