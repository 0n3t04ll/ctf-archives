I got a sweet deal on this keyboard at a garage sale, but I think whoever used it before me messed with the settings. It came with an instruction manual that just says: KKPE{FJZBSVNBYWWOKOJIPNWGPGASCVVYPAYLAHTX}

NOTE: The flag will be in ALL CAPS, like FLAG{...}

NOTE: The flag was typed continuously ðŸŽ¹
