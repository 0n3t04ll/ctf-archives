I found this "impossible sudoku" in some gag gift I got, but after breaking the laws of mathematics, I believe that I have a working solution, but its too dangerous for this world. In fact, I only want to discuss with others who know the solution so I vibecoded this secure website to find those who know, but even https isn't secure enough to transmit this solution. I'll give you my contact information if you can prove you know.

Make sure to get a working solution locally first.
