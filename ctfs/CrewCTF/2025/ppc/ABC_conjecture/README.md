ABC conjecture over polynomials is easy, right?

author: KLPP


Given a triplet (a,b,c), produce polynomials A,B,C in GF(p) such that:
- The number of distinct roots of A is a
- The number of distinct roots of B is b
- The number of distinct roots of C is C

And additionally A+B=C.

Of all solutions, find the one where the maximum degree of A,B and C is minimized.
