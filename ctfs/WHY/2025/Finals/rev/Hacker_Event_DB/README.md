Binary sleuth, we need your help! We recently developed a new data format for keeping track of all the quadrennial Dutch hacker conventions. Our interns have painstakingly filled this database; you can list its contents by doing `./hedb hacker_events.bin`. When we checked our internal repository the other day a new database file called `haxx0r_sc3ntz.bin` appeared out of nowhere. It is much larger in size and doesn't seem to exhibit benign behavior. Can you figure out what the hell is going on here?
