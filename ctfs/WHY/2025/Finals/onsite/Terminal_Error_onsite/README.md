Inspired by this fantastic movie scene.

This is the onsite version of this challenge, there is also an online variant. We have two Game Boys in the tent. One will run the challenge while the other contains a flash card on which you can flash your exploit! Note that you will need to exfiltrate the flag from the target Gameboy. You can best use the BGB emulator for testing. Visit the CTF tent to run your exploit on the real Gameboy.
