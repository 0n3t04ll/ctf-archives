Check out my CPS test! I made sure to sanitize my SQL queries (well except for the register page, but since that one is an insert, you can't really do anything), and I'm so confident that you won't get my admin password that I'll leak the first 5 characters of it!
Note: this challenge is worth zero points due to solve script being accidentally provided. It is available for practice and fun purposes only.
