I was doing some homework for my Data Structures and Algorithms class, but my program unexpectedly crashed when I entered in my flag. Could you help me get it back?
Here's the coredump and the binary, I'll even toss in the header file. Can't give out the source code though, how do I know you won't cheat off me?
