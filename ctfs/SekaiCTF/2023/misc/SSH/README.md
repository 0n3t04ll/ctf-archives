Network Pentest
Jackal got tired of typing yes at every SSH prompt, clearing his known_hosts file each time the remote host's identification changes, etc., so he decided enough is enough, especially that he runs a lot of automated scripts that make use of SSH.
One day, you find yourself in the same network as Jackal and his juicy SSH server, your curiosity gets the better of you and you decide to wear your black hat once again.
You are free to do any port scans/network attacks on the 10.0.0.0/29 subnet. Your goal is to gain access to Jackal's SSH server and uncover its secrets.
‚ùñ Notes:
1. This challenge requires no brute force whatsoever.
2. It might take a few seconds for the OpenVPN connection to be established, if it hangs, CTRL+C and try again.
3. After you start an instance, make sure to adjust the OpenVPN config file with the correct IP address and port.
4. Use the username ctf along with the password obtained from the launcher to authenticate once prompted by the VPN client.
