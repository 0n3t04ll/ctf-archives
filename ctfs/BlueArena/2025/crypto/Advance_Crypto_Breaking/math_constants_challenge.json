  "description": "\n        Welcome to the Math Constants Cipher challenge!\n        \n        We've encrypted a flag using a custom algorithm based on mathematical constants.\n        The algorithm uses:\n        1. Substitution using digits of e, \u03c0, and \u03c6 (golden ratio)\n        2. Position-based transformations with a secret key\n        3. Interleaving of characters\n        4. Base64 encoding\n        \n        Your task is to reverse the algorithm and recover the original flag.\n        The flag format is STURSEC{...}\n        \n        Good luck!\n        "
