Hint:
- Two prime numbers p and q were chosen such that p ≠ q and both > 200
- n = p * q
- φ(n) = (p-1)*(q-1)
- The message m was encrypted using: c = m^e mod n
- e = 65537 (standard RSA public exponent)
- One of the primes leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7
- The flag is in format: STURSEC{plaintext_number}
