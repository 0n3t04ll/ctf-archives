We've intercepted a secret message, but it appears to be encrypted with a variation of Caesar cipher. The encryption seems to use a different shift for each character based on its position. The shift for each character is calculated as: shift = (position_index + 5) % 26. Can you recover the original message? "Xnkjtrx yt ymj hqzg!
