of a custom cipher. The flag is not printed, not stored in plaintext, and cannot be extracted through direct execution. Your objective is to reverse-engineer the .b source file, understand the internal logic, and recover the hidden flag. The challenge requires a deep understanding of the language semantics, control flow analysis, and cipher reconstruction. Execution of the program will not assist in flag recovery â€” successful solving will depend entirely on code analysis and manual or scripted deobfuscation.
