I'm that fella (hey)

 Excuse me, but I'm that fella (hey, hey)

 Think there's a secret in this house (bih', bih',

 bih')

 But we gon' party so hard, we'll knock the walls down

 Flash drive in my garage, think my house has been raided (pow)

 They whisper I need (S, perm) to spread the secret round' (bam,

 bam)

 That's not straight stuff, my man ain't doin it (for real)
