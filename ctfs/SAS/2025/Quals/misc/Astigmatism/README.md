Step back from the screen and, every 20 minutes, gaze 20 feet away

 for 20 seconds. Keep the lighting soft, not too dim or too harsh,

 and remember to blink so your eyes don't dry out. Finally, for

 each hour you play, take a 15-minute break - stretch your legs, sip

 water, and let your eyes rest.

 For this challenge you will need Iris Shaders mod installed

 HINT: Have you seen that guy named Entropy? He is laying low

 somewhere.
