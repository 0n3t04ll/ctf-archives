[IMPORTANT] This challenge involves working with malicious files.

 While we have done our best to ensure that these files cause no

 malicious impact if launched accidentally, please be careful when

 working with them.

 Is this a rabbit? Or a cat? Or a crabbit..., maybe? I'm

 instructed not to click on weird attachments, but this one should be

 my background image for real!
