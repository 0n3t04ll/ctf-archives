You know what a great joke it would be?  
                                          
 It would be a great joke if we made a    
 task about minecraft.                    
 And named it "Signed message", so people 
 would think it's something about         
 certificates or cryptography.            
 But instead made it something completely 
 different.                               
 Yeah, that would be a great joke..
