One of our research VMs started acting   
 weirdly. Also, it is now sending weird   
 DNS requests..                           
 Must be something with the video driver. 
 I tried to fix the registry but now it   
 bluescreens all the time.                
                                          
 Can you fix the registry?                
 And if you could look into the network
