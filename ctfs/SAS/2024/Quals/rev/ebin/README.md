Hello, dear bruh.                        
 Do you know that once upon a time there  
 were cute small Ebins walking around the 
 planet?                                  
 And with the each day passed they        
 evolved, mastered something new...       
 And of course...                         
 They were breeding...                    
 They were becoming more and more         
 perfect...
