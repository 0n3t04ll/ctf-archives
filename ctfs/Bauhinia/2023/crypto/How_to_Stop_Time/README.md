Mystiz
時光邊緣的人
快將一千歲 擦過身邊萬人
怎麼只得我 不老不滅
始終死不去 我似終身被困
時代怎轉變 仍為愛興奮

Good CTF challenges never die. They will be remembered and reused.
Mystiz loves to pay tribute to (i.e., plagarise) challenges. This time he referenced (i.e., copied) code snippets from at least five challenges to build the most unoriginal crypto challenge ever. Also, he is really verbose and there are a lot of red herrings. Can you avoid the rabbit holes and find the vulnerable one(s)?
