量子糾纏
時光是維度　粒子已分佈
在宇宙兩邊
共時地變

I have made an one-time pad encryption using quantum mechanics!
Since it's truly random there is no way you can crack it!
Unless you could perform some quantum entanglement on the qubits...
P.S. Being a quantum challenge, a powerful computer is required (24GB RAM)
to encrypt the flag file! However, whether you could encrypt the flag file
actually doesn't affect whether you could solve the challenge.
