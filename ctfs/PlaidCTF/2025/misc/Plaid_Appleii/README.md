Peter Quill: Fella, how long you been standin’ there? || Drax: Reckon it’s been ‘bout an hour. || Peter Quill: An hour?! || Gamora: You pullin’ our boots? || Drax: I’ve mastered the art of standin’ so still, I become invisible… like a cactus in a sandstorm. Watch this. || Peter Quill: You’re chewin’ on a Zarg-nut, cowboy. || Drax: But my motion... slower than molasses in January... imperceptible to the naked eye. || Peter Quill: Nah, I can still see ya plain as day. || Drax: I'm tellin' ya, I'm invisible as a ghost at high noon. || Mantis: Howdy, Drax. || Drax: ...Darn it.
