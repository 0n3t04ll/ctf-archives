We get a fair share of dusty drifters ridin’ through these parts, so we rigged up a system to help ‘em mosey on through and hit the trail again without too much fuss. Folks ‘round town all pitched in to keep it runnin’ smooth—even the no-good bandits lent a hand! But don’t go thinkin’ the road to Oregon’s all sunshine and wildflowers… it’s still a mighty tough ride.
