Preliminary Investigator. iamcorwin
Type. Weird Artifact
Description. An ornate figurine of a camel with a rather annoying smirk on its face. Reports that the figurine laughs when not looked at have come in, though audio and video surveillance seem to suggest otherwise.
Hypotheses. Probably not actually haunted. The sculptor had a weird sense of humor.
