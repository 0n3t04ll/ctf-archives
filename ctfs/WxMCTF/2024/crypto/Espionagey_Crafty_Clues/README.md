Electron has joined a secret spy agency who sends messsages with coordinates through one of the most common key exchange systems. Unfortunately, Electron sucks at his job and was knocked unconscious by an enemy spy. Seeing how bad Electron was, the enemy spy trolled him and jumbled Electron's special coordinates.

Fortunately, Electron remembers that the spy agency communicates using the coordinate with the highest order. Unfortunately, Electron has a horrible memory, and forgot which coordinate it was and how to encrypt it. Can you help him find the coordinate and encrypt it with the secret exchange system?

The flag is the sum of the x and y coordinates of the shared coordinates wrapped in wxmctf{} (E.g. if the coordinates were (12, 34), the flag would be wxmctf{46})
