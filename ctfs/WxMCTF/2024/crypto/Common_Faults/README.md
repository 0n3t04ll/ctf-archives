lostcactus has a gold vault, but is faulty, so to protect his gold, he encrypted the password with RSA. lostcactus, a fond fan of Euler, generated a list of public keys, until it contained 271828, the first 6 digits of Euler's number. Unfortunatly for lostcactus, just like his vault, his key generator is also faulty, having a COMMON issue with his vault. Help him find his password again.
