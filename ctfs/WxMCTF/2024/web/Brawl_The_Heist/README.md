After getting all of his brawlers to 500 trophies, Eatingfood has found himself in a pickle - there is a Fang on the opposing team every other match and he can no longer play the game! Luckily, he has a plan - to get enough gems to buy every brawler and hypercharge so he can get back to mindlessly mashing buttons and winning. Not wanting to wait and earn gems slowly by normal methods, he has resorted to some slightly more unethical means - uploading a virus into the Brawl Stars servers which would allow him to siphon gems from other players. However, the virus has an unexpected effect: it only allows him to transfer gems to other players. Can you find a way to get him enough gems so he can get back to mindlessly button mashing?
