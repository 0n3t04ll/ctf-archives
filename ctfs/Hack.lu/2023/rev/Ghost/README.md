beginner-friendly!
A wild ghost appeared! We can try our luck at scaring him away. Since you don't know how to use those magic spells yet, we asked our elders for a manual... which... they gave us? But.. Can you help me understand it and show your mastery of the Ghost-scaring by scaring this guy 50 times in a row?
