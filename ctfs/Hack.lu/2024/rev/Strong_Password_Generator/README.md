Last Sunday, I registered at my local gym. It said I had to use a password (or as they call it: "flag"ü§î) generated with their "Strong! Password Generator". It seemed to act a little weird, but I didn't think about it any further. Now I can't remember my password anymore. A truly Strong!‚Ñ¢Ô∏è password generator should be able to recover a lost password though, right?
