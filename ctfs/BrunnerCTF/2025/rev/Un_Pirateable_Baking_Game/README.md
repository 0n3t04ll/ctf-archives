I made a new video game inspired by my favorite YouTuber! It's amazing! But you need a license key to play it, and I haven't set up the webshop yet...
Something with Steam isn't working quite right yet either, so I've removed it for now. But at least the DRM is Un-piratable, so you have to wait to try it ðŸ˜„
