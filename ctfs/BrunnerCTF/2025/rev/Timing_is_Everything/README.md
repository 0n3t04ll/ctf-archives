The local Brunner baker is famous for his perfectly baked cakes - not too soft, not too crispy. But ever since his timer broke, he's been relying on an ancient encrypted recipe vault that only unlocks when the correct timing is entered.

Unfortunately, the baker forgot how the vault works. All he remembers is that "time is the key" and that it once revealed the secret ingredient for the ultimate cake.

Can you figure out how long his cakes need to bake... and recover the secret?
