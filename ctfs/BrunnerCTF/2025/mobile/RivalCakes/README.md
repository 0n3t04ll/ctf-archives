The secret Brunner and Othello cults are waging their battles in the streets of Denmark.

One day, you see a member of the Othello cult drop their phone out of their pocket. You grab it, but it seems to be a burner phone. You find only two custom apps, but when opening one, it instantly deletes itself - maybe there is still some data left?

In the cake cults, preferences matter - so keep an eye out and mind what you say.

Your Othello rivals are planning a secret meetup, find out where and find the password to infiltrate them!

Flag format: The flag is formatted as brunner{<w3w_code>_<password>}, where <w3w_code> is the what3words code of the location, without leading slashes. Make sure your "3 word address language" is set to English.

Example: brunner{candy.magnetic.label_hunter2}
