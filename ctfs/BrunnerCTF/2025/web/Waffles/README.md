Difficulty: Very hard

I have vibecoded a nice webshop for my electronics shop, but someone told me that vibecoding is not safe. Instead I asked ChatGPT to help me. It said something about some WAFF? WAF? Idk, but now I'm hungry for waffles.

Anyway, now it should be so safe that I can even share the source for my app!

Note: The app loads quite slowly. Avoid reloading the page too often as it is rate limited and slow.
