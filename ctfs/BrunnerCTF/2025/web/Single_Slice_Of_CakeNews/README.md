"Brunnerne" has recently acquired the hugely popular website CakeNews.ctf in an effort to expand their empire. Brunnerne has multiple companies and websites under its umbrella, and they all utilize the same single sign on-portal for authentication: BrunnerneLogin.ctf.

In connection with the acquisition, CakeNews.ctf had to overhaul its login and registration flow to hook into Brunnernelogin.ctf. Authentication is now handled entirely by the SSO, but CakeNews keeps its own user table for site-specific data like usernames.

The developers of CakeNews had to implement this new registration system in a rush!
