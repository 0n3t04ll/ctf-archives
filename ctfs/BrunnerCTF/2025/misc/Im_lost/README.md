It started as Baking 101 - just a simple recipe. But then I heard the Bell and got distracted...

One slip in the kitchen and chaos followed. I spilled milk and flour all over the old terminal. It lit up like it hadn't in decades and started screaming in tones that haven't been heard since dial-up ruled the earth.

Now the bits are everywhere, the terminal's rambling, and I've completely lost my direction.

Can you help me clean up this digital mess and find the right path?
