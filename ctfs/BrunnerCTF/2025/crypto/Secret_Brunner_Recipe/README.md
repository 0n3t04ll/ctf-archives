Our secret brunner recipe has been in the family for ages, but due to increased demand, we need to scale up our production. This means new supplies and larger batches, which requires tweaking the recipe. We don't have time ourselves, so we need your help.

There is just one thing... We don't want to share the secret recipe... Instead we have allowed you make tweaks without having to see the recipe itself - it's genius!

We also provided a way to ensure you don't accidentally add "fl√∏deskum" (whipped cream) to the brunner - a despicable practice, no matter how many enjoy it.
