Our brand new baker, ElGamal, has whipped up the most wonderful cheesecake you could ever imagine. Seriously, it's so good it might encrypt your taste buds.

But... there's a problem. One mysterious ingredient is missing from the recipe!
Can you crack the code and figure out what ElGamal forgot to mix in?

The suspiciously scrambled recipe says this:

p  = 14912432766367177751
g  = 2784687438861268863
h  = 8201777436716393968
c1 = 12279519522290406516
c2 = 10734305369677133991
The flag is the recovered plaintext, wrapped in brunner{}.
Example: If you found c4rr0t5, the flag should be submitted as brunner{c4rr0t5}.
