Last night I was out in the darkest of forests, located on Funen, digging for treasure. Lo and behold, I found this mysterious envelope with a note attached: "If you've found this by accident, please leave it where you found it. This is the best brunner recipe to ever be made, and the local baking-cartels have been looking for it, you'll be in great danger for possessing it."

The envelope contained a USB-drive. Naturally, I needed to do an autopsy on this incredible find and plugged it straight into my PC, but it seems like all the good stuff's missing?
