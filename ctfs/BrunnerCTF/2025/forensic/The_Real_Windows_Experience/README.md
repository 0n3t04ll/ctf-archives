Difficulty: Very Hard
Author: OddNorseman

I was trying to migrate away from all of that Microsoft stuff to try and regain independence for my bakery, and after our latest ransomware issues it seemed like the perfect opportunity - and Linux doesn't get malware!

Only problem is that I'm a bit too used to Windows - but my IT guy helped me out with something suuuuper similar. Unfortunately it seems a bit too similar and I've been ransomwared again... Can you help me?

Hint: If this challenge turned into very hard rev and you feel like everything was stripped away from you, you might have fallen short and relied too much on automatic tools in one of the forensics steps.
