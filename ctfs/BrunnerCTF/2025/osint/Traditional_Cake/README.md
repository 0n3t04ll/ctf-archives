I tried this amazing traditional cake at this amazing place I visited... but now I don't remember what it was called and where I was. All I have is this picture I took some time before.

Can you help me find the exact spot I took the image from, so I can try to retrace my steps?

Flag format: Use what3words to find the 3-word code for the location (without leading slashes) and wrap in brunner{}.
So, if the location found has code apricot.surfer.uses, the flag would be brunner{apricot.surfer.uses}.

Note: Make sure "3 word address language" is set to English in your what3words settings to get the right code.
