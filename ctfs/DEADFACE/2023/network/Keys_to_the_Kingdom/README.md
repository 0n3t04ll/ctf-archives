Chuggs pcap steg
Created by: Chuggs

An image was sent across De Monne Financial’s network. They’re still paranoid after being the primary target of DEADFACE last year, and they suspect this is DEADFACE activity. We’re not sure what to make of the PCAP they sent us, but we found a file on the anomalous De Monne machine named keytothekingdom.txt. We suspect that contents of the file have undergone some form of encoding or encryption. See if you can piece these two things together to find the flag in the pcap.

Submit the answer as flag{here-is-the-answer}.
