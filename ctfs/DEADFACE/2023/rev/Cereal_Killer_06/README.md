Dark Angel has a favorite cereal, but donâ€™t expect him to tell you what it is! He is a mercenary hacker that contracts to Lytton Labs, so he is extremely paranoid about protecting all of his personal information, even his favorite cereal! He treats it like a closely guarded government secret!

Choose the Windows or Linux binary to see if you can defeat Dark Angel and get access to his deep, dark secret cereal!
