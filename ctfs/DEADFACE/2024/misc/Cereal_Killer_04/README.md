Dr. Geschichter of Lytton Labs is working on a new way to influence young children to do his evil bidding. He's using MONSTER CEREALS to DO IT!!! He is putting trigger words on the cereal boxes, so while the kids are eating their cereals and reading the boxes, they will ACTUALLY be reading their ACTIVATION CODES that put them into a hyper-suggestible state. Then, using Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and Subliminal Seduction, he plans on programming them to carry out his nefarious plans!

Submit the flag as flag{flag-text}.

(So... Dr. Geschichter is a BOOMER, so I think there is a tiny flaw in his plan. This is now 2024, and I don't think Charles realizes that kids no longer READ the cereal boxes while they are eating their cereal. They are usually staring at iPhones or iPads while doing that. But please, don't tell HIM that... we'd really want to keep kids away from MK Ultra!!!)

(There is a chance this program will trigger an Anti Virus alert. In that case, make an exception for it. It is safe, I assure you… unless you run it while reading the back of a cereal box…)
