The security team at NexGen Softworks reached out to us regarding a potential tip about DEADFACE. They were alerted to unusual email traffic between one of their employees and a third-party vendor regarding infrastructure upgrades. The email chain looks fairly innocent, but NexGen’s SEIM flagged it as suspicious and they’re not sure why.
