Recovered from chat logs, we think this is supposed to be the password for an encrypted file. As you can tell, it is anything but complete.

I know it's a bit time consuming, but see if you can figure the rest out.

Hint: Use 7zip "Hey y'all, Shamel here, I messed up the password for the zip file, please replace all lowercase p characters with Uppercase P characters" "also use the photo to get the correct answer the ods file seems to flip the puzzle"
