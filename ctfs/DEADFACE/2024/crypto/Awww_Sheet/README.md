It appears DEADFACE has shifted its focus to the music scene, but I'm not convinced this is just about melodies and rhythms. There's something more to this—I'm certain it's some kind of coded message.

While deciphering sheet music isn't my area of expertise, I'm confident you'll know how to crack this. I’m assigning this mission to you—dig into it and uncover what DEADFACE is hiding.

Start by exploring Ghost Town—there may be some hidden clues to help you unravel this mystery.

Try NOT to REST on this too much, this needs to be solved soon.
