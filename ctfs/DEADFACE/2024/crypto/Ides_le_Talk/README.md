We intercepted a file from one of DEADFACE’s more amateur members. They claim that they hid a password in a text file. When we looked at the file, it’s indecipherable jibberish. We believe a common cipher was used to hide the message (and the password). As far as possible keys goes, maybe it can be determined by the author of the original text?
