    You are allowed to only have one account. Creating multiple CTFd accounts is prohibited and will result in a ban.
    The challenge controls a physical robot. Every attempt to damage it or anything in the physical world will be harshly punished.
    Do no try to move out of the arena we built.
    Hacking the robot is not part of the challenge. The scope of the challenge is limited to the web application only.

Context:

    the buttons in the main page can be used to execute the actions.
    if a button is disabled, the action is owned by another team, so you cannot buy it.
    if a button is blue, no one owns the action, so it can be bought (supposed you have sufficient balance).
    if a button is green, you are the owner and you can execute it.
