RoboTank is back! And he's stronger then ever!

Last year only one team was able to pwn our favourite tank, but this year nobody, nobody will win!

Why? Try and pwn our RoboTank while a team of experts is constantly changing the server's parameters every 5 minutes.

Watch out! We think someone is corrupting them! Follow the live stream on YouTube: https://2024.snakectf.org/robotank-live

What are those cards? Mmmh, it seems Minesweeper, but slightly different.

Since it's our game, we make the rules

    Do not go outside the arena
    Do not harm RoboTank
    Each card will contain a tuple (x,y) where x is the number of adjacent bombs and y is the number of adjacent pieces of flag.
    Bombs will disable the tank for 5 minutes
    Do not create multiple CTFd accounts to solve RoboTank, otherwise you will be banned!

Have fun!
