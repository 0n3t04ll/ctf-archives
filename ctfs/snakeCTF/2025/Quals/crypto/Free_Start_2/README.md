It looks like it is impossible! We have used Anemoi in Sponge mode to generate the hash.

However, this hash was generated in such a way that an easy root can be found from the Anemoi polynomial representation. Try to find the original message that is composed of 4 elements in the field.

FLAG FORMAT Once you have found the 4 items message [m1, m2, m3, m4], the flag is snakeCTF{M} where M is the concatenation of m1, m2, m3, m4.

For example, if we obtain [124, 43, 65, 13], the flag is snakeCTF{124436513}.
