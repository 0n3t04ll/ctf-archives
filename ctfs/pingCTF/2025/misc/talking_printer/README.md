I woke up, and my printer started emitting strange noises. It sounded like it was screaming at me—high-pitched, garbled, almost like it was trying to talk. At first, I thought it was just another one of its tantrums, the usual passive-aggressive clicks and whirs. But this was different. The beeping had a rhythm, a pattern, like some kind of hidden message.

Was my printer... sending signals? Maybe I’ve been ignoring its ink warnings for too long, and this is its final revenge. Whatever it is, I need to figure out what it's trying to say—before it jams every single page I ever print again.
