I wanted to see what is displayed on this screen, but i think contrast is too low. Fortunately, you are looking like someone who can read ones and zeroes. I have connected ones and zeroes capture device to the screen and saved the output. Can you help me to read it? HINT: https://sigrok.org/wiki/File_format:Sigrok/v2 setup1.png setup2.png
