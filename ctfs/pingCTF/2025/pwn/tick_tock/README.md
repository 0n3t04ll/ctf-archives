I have created a super secure server for checking flags. I only had some old ARM hardware lying around, so I had to improvise. The check binary is written in C, so it should be blazingly fast. Also, I have added a time counter so you can see how fast C really is.

HINT: testing tick-tock locally using made up flags

HINT2: characters used in tick tock are: "13457unsdchr_"

NOTE: This chall is quite cpu intensive and we have not implemented rate limiting xd. Please be gentile with our servers
