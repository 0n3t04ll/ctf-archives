Your friend is trying to pass this car game that he made. Sadly, they have long term memory loss and they don't remember the inputs or the goal of the game. All they have is the code. You should help them, as something hidden (like a flag?) will display if you find the correct inputs.
Note: if you have a flag that works on the challenge file but isn't accepted, please DM the author (or another organizer).
