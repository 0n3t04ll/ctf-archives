Few people farm their own map for BP1. I did. That was played 6 years ago though.

Recently I retried the top difficulty and got a terrible score. At least I passed the map with HDDT...But what happend to the life bar on the score screen?

Wrap the string in osu{}. Flag format is osu\{[A-Z0-9_]+\}.
