Our Security Service reasonably thinks one of the employees transferred classified data.
Suspect is quite extravagant person - uses old fashioned Samsung E100 only, never uses capital letters and obsessed with beer.
It was reported that he met an unknown person in a pub in Kensington, London. The recon team could not confirm direct contact between the suspect and the unidentified person. Also it was impossilbe to establish remote access to suspect's phone.
But the field operative retrieved audio from the phone close to the suspect for audio surveillance. Also, a transfer of suspicious encrypted file via WiFi was detected.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find evidence against the rogue employee and retrieve the classified data.
