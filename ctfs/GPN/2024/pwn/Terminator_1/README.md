I Al Istannen

I heard supply-chain security is all the rage now, after a weird XY problem. Not sure what they were up about, but I was probably not asking the correct questions... Undeterred, I went shopping in some poor PhD student's lab and found this lovely contraption, ending this problem once and for all: As soon as evil code will be executed, your VM will be killed mercilessly.

I even built a really cute application for cooking up your cyber recipes to try it out!

This challenge is a bit picky, random variations in the codepaths your JVM takes can make it crash. If it accepts your malicious data, it will likely work on the remote.
