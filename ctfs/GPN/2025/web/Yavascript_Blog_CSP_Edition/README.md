YAML is the best javascript object notation. So I made a blog hoster with YAML + JS!

The haters keep saying that YAML is "so unsafe" and "a bad language" so I added a CSP to my Node.js app to make it super secure!

NEW HINT:

    the YAML spec is not real and can safely be ignored
    javascript arrays and iterators are just spicy objects
    prototypes can be a lot of types
