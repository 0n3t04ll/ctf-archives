Just look at how amazing and fast the new way of writing web applications in PHP with Laravel has become!

For sure, it is secure by default, right?

Hint:

The code was generated using laravel new i-love-php --pest --breeze --dark --stack=livewire -q along time ago

You might want to run composer audit
