We have probable intel that our target tried to prove their flag?!

As you can see in the leaked sources, the admin user placed a flag into a model. It is vital that you get access to their account and recover the flag.

We are also very excited to tell you that our agents are certain that you don't have to touch anything related to the prover itself, just recover the flag and get out of this hell as quickly as possible!
