In the spirit of open source I publish my code, though I wish there existed a better version control than project-latest-final-final-2.tar.zst.

I love checking out what other people do with my code, but in this cruel world you need to take precautions.

Therefore, I only check out the good code I have written myself.

Looking forward to your submissions!
