The flag consists of two parts.

- The first part is broadcasted by AMOP *publically* with the title `flag1`.
- The second part is broadcasted by AMOP *privately* with the title `flag2`.
    - while the subscriber's privkey is attached

BTW, 
1. The sdk folder provides you with necessary files to interact with the node.
2. The fisco-bcos version is `2.9.1`.
3. The remote broadcast message uses [java-sdk-demo](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/java-sdk-demo) main-2.0
