Haii!! I need your help! >_>

There's this microcelebrity girlypop game developer called Amels I'm really fond of. I've been following her work EXTENSIVELY! on her social media!! (Call me a big fan)

(She hates alot of common social medias like Instagram, Twitter, etc., so it was really hard to find it >_<)

However, there's this new game that I really, REALLY want to play!! I've heard, from what she's been saying, that it's called SpaceTime, but I can't seem to find it anywhere! I'm not that much of an OSINT GOD like u seem to be, could u maybe help me figure it out? :c

Can you find the listing of the game and gain access to it? Pweeese!! I neeed to play it :(
