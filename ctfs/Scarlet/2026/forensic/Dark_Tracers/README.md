Would you look at that!? We have a fake murder-for-hire case on our desk. Lovely. Anyway, ASAC Bobr wants you to trace through the transaction to identify the most likely hash that indicates the payment made from the perp to the scammer for the agreed upon amount.

Here is what we believe is the transaction made from a Bitcoin ATM to one of the addresses associated with the perpetrator's wallet:

427e04420fffc36e7548774d1220dad1d20c1c78dd71ad2e1e9fd1751917a035

Find the transaction made from the victim to the scammer and upload the transaction hash as the flag!

Here is the press release for the case, a young agent like you always needs some good old context.

FLAG FORMAT: RUSEC{hash}

For example, if you think the transaction hash is 49100341fe8d99bd1ed7cec22edf0ec63d6920a01627e34249b2dfb3c464bca0, upload it in the format:

RUSEC{49100341fe8d99bd1ed7cec22edf0ec63d6920a01627e34249b2dfb3c464bca0}
