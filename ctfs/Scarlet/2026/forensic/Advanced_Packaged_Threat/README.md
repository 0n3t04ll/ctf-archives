Earlier on in the year I used a custom PPA for a long-discontinued library I needed in my experimental program. I ended up not using it, but soon forgot about it later on. However, this morning, I went to check back in on my server and discovered a strange SSH public key in my root SSH user.

I have a packet capture from yesterday detailing everything happening on the network. Could you maybe take a look at it?
