Comrades at the Institute for BioSafety have developed a prototype BCU-8 chip. They were able to get a simple diffusion experiment running successfully, but they're having trouble successfully running the transcription experiment. We keep getting the result "bad", can you figure out proper parameters?

(Same handout as the other BCU challenges)
