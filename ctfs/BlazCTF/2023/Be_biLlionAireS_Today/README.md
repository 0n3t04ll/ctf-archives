Tony led the tech team for a shady Ethereum L2. He assured the CEO that a multi-signature wallet architecture would help protect user funds. He claimed private keys of multisig owners were stored in different hardware wallets and tattooed under his feet so it is super safe.

Note: This challenge runs on fork of Ethereum. Tony added three additional addresses to the multisig:
- 0x6813Eb9362372EEF6200f3b1dbC3f819671cBA69
