Our OS professor keeps talking about Rowhammer, and how dangerous it is. I don't believe him. Can you really steal the flag from my kernel with just 1 bitflip?

Base repo is https://github.com/IAIK/sweb (commit ad1b59a5c2acbd4bff346bdf282a4d5e21bd9cb1) Build instructions at here


# Notes

This is a setup to run a fixed kernel with new userspace.
Please read the instructions [here](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/teaching/materials/os/tutorials/prerequisites-installation/) to find out how to compile and run.

The same instructions also work for the source code at https://github.com/iaik/sweb, which is probably easier for debugging.
