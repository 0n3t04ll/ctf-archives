I'm competing in a CTF so I don't have time to make my 3-city-elves challenge. How about you guys help me with the CTF I'm in by submitting some writeups? I would really appreciate it! I only need some kind of medical hardware hacking, like insulin pump hacking. Supply chain is also acceptable. Don't try to do anything silly, the writeup submission comes with a next-gen WAF. We need your help to beat Contraband Manchester United and Sigma Pony!
