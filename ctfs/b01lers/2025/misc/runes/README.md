tillvit

The ancient Sumerians were good at math, but did you know they were also good at programming? We dug up this tablet that seems to resemble code, but we can't seem to decipher or run it with our existing tools!

Legend says that the Sumerians valued the sun and represented it as a ð’Š¹; perhaps we should try to make the the tablet output it?
