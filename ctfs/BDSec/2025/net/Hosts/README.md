A serious incident occurred inside a corporate network — an attacker successfully breached the internal environment. What followed was a series of stealthy moves: network reconnaissance, service enumeration, exploitation, and finally, remote code execution (RCE).

Unfortunately, the entire attack was not captured during the incident but we were to capture some of it.
