Someone from a dark web forum sent me a "premium" IoT firmware—claimed it was legit and offered it for free. I tried flashing it onto a device, but it seems broken... or maybe intentionally messed with. I have a feeling something’s hidden inside. Can you reverse the firmware and see if there’s anything interesting buried in it?
