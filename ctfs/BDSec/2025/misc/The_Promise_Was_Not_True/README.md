She called herself a witch. Said the magic would know me. Said I didn’t need anything else — no wand, no spellbook, no runes.

She promised I’d understand when the time came. But her promise wasn’t true.

Then she vanished, leaving behind a sealed arcane box. It demands a 7-digit passcode to open. No clues… except one line in her handwriting:

“You already have everything you need.”

She always said that. But like most spells — it was not true.

Note : You need to submit the passcode with flag format BDSEC{passCode} Example : If the final result/pass code is 1234567 then the flag will be BDSEC{1234567}
