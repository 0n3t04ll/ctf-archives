On April 16th, KSHACKZONE’s Forensics Division was contracted to examine an audio file recovered during a routine network threat hunt. The file — a 5-minute WAV labeled “chant_of_the_drones.wav” — was flagged due to anomalous frequency spikes and a suspicious file size inconsistent with its audio content.

Preliminary playback revealed only ambient static and tonal droning. However, deeper spectral inspection uncovered a high-frequency Morse sequence embedded just below the audible threshold. This led investigators to a string of DTMF tones.

A breakthrough occurred when the file was reversed and examined again. Frequency-domain binary patterns emerged, representing a short XOR key encoded via alternating 500Hz and 1000Hz tones. The final discovery was found inside the white noise segment appended to the end of the file — where the actual payload had been embedded using LSB steganography with xoring key.

KSHACKZONE now requires a full forensic reconstruction of the message. Analysts are tasked with extracting and decoding the hidden payload from the supplied audio. You are provided with the original chant_of_the_drones.wav for analysis.
