Welcome to Unfair Chess! You always get to play White, but there's a catch, a couple actually!

For every move you play, Black gets two! Stockfish plays against you!

Really straight forward, survive 50 moves, you win.

You can get your Italians ready by 1. e2e4 or play Queen's Gambit with 1. d2d4

I played 1. d2d4 then 2. c2c4 then 3. d1d4 and lost my Queen :'(

Good luck to you though!
