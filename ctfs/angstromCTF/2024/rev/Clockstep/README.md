Someone tried to break into my super-secure flag checking machine!! They didn't get the flag, fortunately, but I'm still suspicious - can you check out this execution trace and see what they were doing? Don't worry, the flag data is stored securely on the processor, so don't worry about accidentally stumbling across it.
