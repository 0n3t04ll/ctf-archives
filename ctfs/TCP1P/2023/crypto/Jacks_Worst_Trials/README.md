Jack, a web developer intern, is asked to make a website for his trial probation in his company. Some say a treasure will be given to anyone who is able to log in as an admin, although not a single person is assigned as an admin by Joe, not even himself.

Note: He's a bit old-fashioned, so it's not surprising that he uses outdated components for his website.
