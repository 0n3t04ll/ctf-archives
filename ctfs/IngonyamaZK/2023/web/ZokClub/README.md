In the last night's operation, the Crypto Police have discovered the former meeting place of a notorious anonymous crypto criminal secret society known as the "ZokClub." The police raided the location after receiving a tip-off from an anonymous source and found nothing except for a single note.

The note read: S: u7T4mpNKO1H1ByNF; N: h3KOJlQKbveOBQB8 The meaning behind the note remains a mystery, but it is suspected to be a code that only members of the ZokClub would understand.

The ZokClub has been known to operate in the shadows of the dark web, engaging in illegal activities such as money laundering and hacking. The group's anonymity and sophisticated use of blockchain technology have made it difficult for law enforcement agencies to track them down, despite the fact they have their own public web page: https://zokclub.ctf.ingonyama.com/

We need your help to understand what are they up to. Try to infiltrate their group and gather the secret information.
