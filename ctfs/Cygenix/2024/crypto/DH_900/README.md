The robots just introduced this supposedly unbreakable crypto scheme that allows them to share secrets over insecure channels, DH-9000. I'm pretty sure this isn't anything new though, so we should still be able to find their shared secret.

p = 8089

g = 823

A = 7608

B = 5796

Note: submit the shared secret wrapped in CyGenixCTF{}
