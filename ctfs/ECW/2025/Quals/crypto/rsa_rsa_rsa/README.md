In this challenge, the participant's task is to decrypt a message that has been encoded in .png. The modulus N for RSA is also given, however no other information is given. Because the modulus is large and prime, prime factorization is not possible, so alternative methods must be used. Luckily, as the modulus is prime, the Euler totient of N is equal to N-1, hence the ciphertext can be decrypted. Sometimes you need multiple primes, sometimes you need only one.
