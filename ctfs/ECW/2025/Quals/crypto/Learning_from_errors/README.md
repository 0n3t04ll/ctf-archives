A communication has been intercepted containing encrypted data by the DOSEAL initiative (Defensive Operation for Satellite Encrypted Analysis Localization). It seems to be related to a KEM public key that our experts confirmed to be a post-quantum mechanism, and the corresponding public key has been found. The secret key is nowhere to be found.

However, our informant has provided the DOSEAL key generation source code and a memory dump of one generation.

Can the secret document of the DOSEAL initiative be retrieved?
