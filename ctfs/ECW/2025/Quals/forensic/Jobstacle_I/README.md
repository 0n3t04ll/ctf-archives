It looks like the enemy is recruiting...

One of our agents was contacted by a recruiter for a company working in weapons technology, Hammer Industries. A big contract apparently, but we don't know the company well. Our analysts, however, suspect that it has a connection to the drone attacks observed recently.

Two weeks ago, investigations led to the discovery of a hidden ZIP file on their website. The file, named hammer.zip, appeared to be an innocuous technical archive containing documentation...

Analyze this archive (no bruteforce needed) and let us know if anything interesting is found there.
