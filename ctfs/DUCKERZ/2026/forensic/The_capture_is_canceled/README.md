I was listening to the radio broadcast here when I suddenly saw strange signals - some kind of new protocol, but I don't understand it at all. I thought about giving up, but I heard on the news that the copter was flying and no one knows its route. Maybe you can find at which point the drone flew at the maximum altitude? The coordinates of the place should be given by reference, ± 10m
