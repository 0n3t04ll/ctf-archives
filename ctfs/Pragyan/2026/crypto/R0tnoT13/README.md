During a security audit of a custom cryptographic module, you obtain partial diagnostic logs from a faulty randomness subsystem.

The subsystem maintains an internal 128-bit state derived from AES, which is periodically inspected for integrity using bit-rotation consistency checks.

For specific, preconfigured rotation offsets k, the firmware records the value:

S ⊕ ROTR(S, k)

where S is the internal state at that time. These checks are intended only to verify hardware wiring correctness and were never meant to be exposed.

Due to a logging misconfiguration, only a small subset of these diagnostic frames was captured before the system crashed.

Given:

-Several leaked diagnostic frames of the form S ⊕ ROTR(S, k)

-The corresponding rotation offsets k

-Two anchor bits of the internal state

-A ciphertext encrypted using the internal state

Reconstruct the state and recover the flag.
