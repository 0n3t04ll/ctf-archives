The Joker left only one thing at the crime scene this time: a single file named smile.bin.

No threats, no riddles, no recordings — just that one file and a smear of blood on the wall that read:

“A joke’s only funny when you get it.”

GCPD’s cyber forensics division believes the file contains a hidden message, but every attempt to inspect it has turned up nothing but noise, corruption, and formats that make no sense together. It’s almost as if the Joker stitched different pieces of evidence into one corpse of a file, daring someone to pull it apart.

If there is a message buried in there — in the static, in the distortion, in the silence between the bits — you’ll have to find it yourself.

The clock is ticking. He’s waiting for someone to laugh.
