An internal investigation flagged an anomalous access event involving a restricted internal resource. The activity blends in with routine network traffic and appears to have relied on valid credentials, rather than exploiting a software flaw.

A packet capture was taken during the suspected time window.

Your task is to analyze the capture and determine:

The identity of the account responsible for the access

The credentials used during the incident

Only one account successfully reached the restricted resource.
