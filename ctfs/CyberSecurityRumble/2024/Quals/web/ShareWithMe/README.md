Kalmar CTF was really noice, glad we met for this IRL. You took a lot of pictures and videos right? Could you send them over? I've set up a nextcloud shared folder for that. If you send exceptionally good stuff you might get a flag in exchange! Use nc sharewithme.rumble.host 1337 to get the url for the shared folder.
