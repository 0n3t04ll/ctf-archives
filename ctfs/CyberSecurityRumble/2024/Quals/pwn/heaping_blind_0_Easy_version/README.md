Look at my scalable messaging service! I hope you can't infer some internal behaviour/heap layout that might be useful for heap exploitation. Connect via netcat:

We even launched a 31337 bug bounty program, rewarding hackers with flags.

This is a simplified version of the full version, that does not feature interfering heap operations.
