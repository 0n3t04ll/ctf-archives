In the world of encryption, let me tell you, bigger is better, folks. When you're talking about RSA, you want an exponent that's huge, believe me. Some people say, "Oh, go small for efficiency." But I say, forget about efficiency, we're talking about security! With a big exponent, you're going to have the best security, nobody's going to crack it, nobody! So, remember: go big or go home, and you'll be winning bigly in cybersecurity!
