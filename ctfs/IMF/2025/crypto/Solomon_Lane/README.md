Osint and Crypto

Mission Brief

They moved in silence, past the flame,Unknown, unseen, without a name.Through laser grids and traps ornate,The team advanced toward sector eight.With every code they reallocate,And spoof the trace to obfuscate.One file remained, the logs rotateâ€”Its label strange, syndicate.Not shouted loud, just tucked away,But those who know decode the play.
