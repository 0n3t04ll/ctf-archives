After a while, you wake up in a room next to a broken table, surrounded by big walls from all sides. You have always been an explorer and recently discovered this old building; looking around it seems like it may be a library, but you see a blinking green light in the distance. As you approach the light you realize it is a blinking terminal with a ethereum keystore file that you created long time ago, encrypted with a password which you can't remember as of now. Can you crack the password, and wander through one of the publicly available block explorers to locate the super secret flag? I believe you can!
You Rock!
