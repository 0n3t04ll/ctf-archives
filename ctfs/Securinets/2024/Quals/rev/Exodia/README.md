Our game development team has experienced a security breach, and unfortunately, the hackers managed to compromise the game while it's still in its BETA phase. We believe they may have tampered with various aspects of the game, so please be aware that you might encounter several bugs. If you'd like to assist the development team, we encourage you to document any issues you come across and submit them after the CTF concludes. Your help is greatly appreciated!
