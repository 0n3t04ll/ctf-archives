It's past one, I was probably sleeping in front of my screen, I'm not even sure if I was awake for a bit or not, I'm not even sure if I'm dreaming or not... All I know is that I left the device on my favorite channel and that piece of crap failed me. Agh I need to fix it now. It is no longer responding to the commands I give it, and it is no longer showing my favorite channel! I hate my life, can you help me fix it?
I am looking for three stuff:
What nonsense was I watching the night the device failed me?
I might need the Up and Down key codes in NEC 32-bit format?
The expiration date of my IPTV subscription.
The flag format is: Securinets{show_name_00UP1234_DOWN1234_YYYYMMDD}
