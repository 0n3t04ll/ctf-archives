We gave our new agent a tough job - keep important information safe. We made a pretend situation to see how well he can hide the data. Now, he's gone to another country for this mission. He left us a little hint to help you catch him and get back the secret info. Your job is to use this hint and try different ways to check if the agent is keeping the data safe. We want to find out if he's good at protecting important stuff.
