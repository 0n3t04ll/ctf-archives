A ticket just came in the Admin said he was testing out some new Security Encodings on the 'AnonyMouse' server Login and it just FROZE while he was putting in the password can you help get it unstuck. Admin looked at the code and he discovered that someone else had put additional commands as well as #Comments and it may have been a purposeful. Possibly the work of Reverse Engineering h4k0r??? He also says the program is still doing something when he types because he sees the cursor flash.
