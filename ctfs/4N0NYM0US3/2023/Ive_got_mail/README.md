Found this WAV recording from checking my AOL e-mail from my Ex-"Jenny" from way back in the day.
Connecting to the internet via a modem in the 90s was like music to my ears, I miss the modem handshake process.
Can you find out how I would get ahold of her using this wave file. Her information has to somewhere the AOL.wav file.
Description of Wave File: "DTMF Tones..... EeeEeerp Skeeerurp Kiirup, BeeeEeeeEeeeEeeekur, EeeyaEeeyaEEE, cuuuuurrrrrrrr, keeeeeeeerrr, (ROBOT NOISE)beep, ccuuurch "
