We stumbled upon a 3.5'' ðŸ’¾ Floppy Disk from 1995 that used to belong to our friend Joey. We know that there is a flag hidden within a file on it. Can you find the flag no lie it's not going to be easy. FYI Joey liked to hide things, sometimes in plain sight like encoded text other times not in plain sight like compressed files with passwords. Hopefully you have good scanning and sorting skills.
