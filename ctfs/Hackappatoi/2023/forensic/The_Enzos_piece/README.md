We can't find Enzo. We've searched everywhere, but it seems like he's entered another dimension... Perhaps in a virtual world. Maybe his health condition isn't good, and he's seeking a place to hide his treasure. He left only a clue that says:"My wealth and treasure? It can be yours if you want it! Search for it! I left everything in that one place."
