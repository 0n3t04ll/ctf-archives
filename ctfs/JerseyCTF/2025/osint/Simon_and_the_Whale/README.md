The neon buzzed outside Simon’s window, humming like a bad omen. Ever since G0ldenFalc0n7 showed up, things had gotten… complicated. People were vanishing into thin air, reappearing randomly. Dr. Tom was repeatedly coming near campus, despite his usual absense these last few years. Anna, who normally had ice in her veins, was now squirreled away whispering secrets only the walls could hear. Or so she thought.

Simon caught a whiff of something. This whole thing was rancid. While trying to talk to Anna, he overheard her whispering frantically, her voice was barely audible, dripping with a level of warmth and anxious concern he had not heard from her. "Storing it publicly wasn't smart," she whispered. "You're risking everything, Arthur! You could ... What if it gets pulled?!"

That sealed it. Who was Arthur? Something was afoot. Anna would never betray NICC, this was her world! And the other day Simon was told they saw her with someone who looked like the G0ldenFalc0n7...

Is Anna working with The Consortium? Is she working with GoldenFalc0n7? Or is this something deeper?

Simon has his hands full—he needs you to follow the trail. The answers are out there, hidden in plain sight. You just need to look in the right place. Find it and get ready for the next step.
