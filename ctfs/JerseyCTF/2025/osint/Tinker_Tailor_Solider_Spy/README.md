Well, maybe not a tinker... But we need help gaining a foothold against the Consortium and stopping the Turing Lock from completion.

Luckily we have somebody working on some powerful tech. They couldn't make the dead-drop location, but managed to offload it somewhere else.

Our contact said one of the first american spies would mark the spot, but they couldn't remember which spy it was. However, he does know that it's close to that guy who died dueling someone who made some disparaging remarks about his father, among 8 others nearby. So it should be straightforward to narrow down.

Get us the name of the spy and the coordinates, and we'll go pick it up!

Flag Format: jctfv{Lastname_latitude,longitude} Our system won't handle DMS coordinates, so get the DD cordinates for us.
