Anna received some intelligence that The Consortium was trying to get their hands on some machine learning researcher. The intel was scrambled, but the phrase "machine learning researchers are not good programmers" kept repeating. She needs to get to the researcher before they do. We called up our friends at Osiris Lab but they haven't seen the professor around the Brooklyn campus in a while... And he's not in the Village either. Maybe he's in hiding or maybe he's just out enjoying one of his hobbies... If he's hiding out, maybe he's spending time with his evil brother? Let's see if we can track them down.

Can you help Anna find the three hobbies they have in common? Once we have that she'll be able to narrow it down. Everything you need should be online, so thankfully we won't need to bother calling anyone.

Flag Format: If a hobby has multiple words, separate those words by a hyphen. Separate hobbies using an underscore _ jctfv{hobby-one_hobby-two_hobby-three}
