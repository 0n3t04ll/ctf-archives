A stranger walked in off the street, coat dripping from the rain, fed me a story that smelled like a week-old alibi. Said there was a problem, it was urgent. Rumor has it that one of the hand picked agents in a new government agency was already compromised. Not by The Consortium, if the whispers in the alleys are true. One of our older enemies, maybe?

This one's deep. Real deep. But how deep is that alleged connection? That’s the million-dollar question. Lucky for us, people leave digital footprints the way drunks leave bar tabs—careless, messy, and easy to follow if you know where to look.

If the rumors are on the level, this guy's got some big balls - bigger than you'd expect for someone playing a double game.

Our team is good, real good. If you can grab us a few bits of information, we can get to the rest and find out for ourselves if this is true. Go shake some trees and knock on doors until you get their primary github username - the one for his diamond business. After that, track down his alleged maternal grandfather's first name and his alleged maternal great-grandfather's first name.

Get us that, and we’ve got leverage. We’ve got a way in. Without it? We’re flying blind, and we don’t have a doge in the fight.

Flag format: jctfv{username_grandfathersinitials_greatgrandfathersFirstName} Example if the username was anonymous, his grandfather's initials were ABC, and his great grandfather's name was Billy: jctfv{anonymous_ABC_Billy}

The flag will not be case sensitive.
