Back when NICC’s coffers were light enough to be collected in person, I got stuck with the worst job in the outfit—waiting in bank lines that moved slower than cold molasses. That was over a decade ago, but I remember the feeling. Stale air. The tick of the clock. The sound of my patience being ground into dust.

Only thing that kept me from losing my mind? A bright yellow billboard across the street. Big, bold numbers staring back at me, burning into my brain like a bad memory. A phone number. One I can’t seem to recall now, no matter how hard I try.

Thing is, I’m starting to think that number wasn’t just some meaningless ad. It might be important. Dr. Tom Lei seems to think so, too, seeing as his goons have been asking around town non-stop about it.

I dug up a picture of the bank I wasted years at. Maybe you can piece together what my memory won’t. What was the phone number on the billboard?
