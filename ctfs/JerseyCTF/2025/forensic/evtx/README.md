It appears that one of the low-level grunts of the NICC organization have gone rogue. They keep trying to get into a user's account by guessing their password. Can you tell us 1. the name of the user who is being targeted with brute force password guessing attempts and 2. the number of times the rogue user has tried to get into the account? The flag should have the format jctfv{Name_Number} where Name is the username and Number is the count.
