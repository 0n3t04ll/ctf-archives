Our intelligence operatives have been chasing after a strange secretive operation between Dr. Lei and Roko, where Lei appears to be giving some sort of secret "upgrade" to Roko that even his close trusted peers aren't aware of.

Just recently, we were able to gain access to a very important server regarding this operation, but it appears they anticipated us coming and thoroughly wiped their entire hard drive of everything. The only things we managed to recover were some strange music files which appeared to have been generated by Roko himself, along with the access token we came looking for. Unfortunately, they encrypted it before we got there in time.

The only other information we have regarding this are the messages we intercepted between Lei and Roko. Information regarding the encryption process is that it was using some sort of secret password, and since we know they're quite fond of AES, the lack of an IV makes us pretty certain it's in ECB mode. They also mentioned the use of a primitive hashing scheme and, judging from their past, VERY heavily hate anything with less than 256 bits of security.

We're unsure what this all means, but we do have the files we exfiltrated from their server. Maybe it has more use than we originally thought.
