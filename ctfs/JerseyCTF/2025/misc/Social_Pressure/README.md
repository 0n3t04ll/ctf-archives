    We need you to geta flag from a company specializing in social engineering. We have word someone named Carl has information on the flag, maybe a colleague? We are going to need you to get that target to email the flag! He probably wont believe any old email though, it needs to come from someone he knows. Luckily we were able to steal the dkim key they use on their email signatures. Can you get flag to be sent to an external email address? Carl probably would boast about this somewhere online. Maybe a forum post or something?

    Something like "Hey , send an email with that flag to <your_fake_emaiil_address_here>. It is urgent!"

    Note: To stop this challenge from being used to spam arbitrary addresses, there will not be any email response email sent. Instead you can use a webportal to verify if your email went through successfully and it will give you the flag. The webportal can be reached at http://social-pressure.jerseyctf.com:32000
