    A careless RB-affiliated Netrunner fumbled a Bitcoin transaction 11 years ago, leaving a trail across the blockchain. It seems some marshals took hold of our BTC, which originated from only the most legitimate business ventures, of course.

    NICC needs you to follow the money—trace the transactions and find the final wallet holding the flag! But be careful—before reaching the destination, the funds passed through another wallet that you'll need to track along the way.

    The wallet is 1Ez69SnzzmePmZX3WpEzMKTrcBF2gpNQ55 and the transaction is 29.659K BTC! Hopefully that doesn't equal a lot of USD these days...

    The flag format is jctfv{walletHash}
