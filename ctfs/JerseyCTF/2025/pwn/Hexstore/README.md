medium piece of the final puzzle

    The Consortium just unveiled their newest project: HexStore.
    It appears to be an online "museum" of sorts, where they share images to the world to better boost their image and align them against us.
    They seem to be hiding an important "antique". We're not entirely sure what it is, but we don't really like the sounds of it. Think you could help?
