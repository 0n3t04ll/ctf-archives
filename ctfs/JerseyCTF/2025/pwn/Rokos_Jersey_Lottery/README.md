hard piece of the final puzzle

    We managed to uncover a mysterious underground lottery going on, hosted by Roko himself.
    It seems like he's really put all his effort into securing it, but we did manage to extract the crucial data and software before he locked us out for good.
    We need to grab that flag before he auctions it off for good, can you help us?
    If it helps, prior to the alleged launch of this lottery, Roko was going on about the number 647389. We're not sure what it means, but it might help.
