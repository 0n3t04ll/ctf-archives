easy piece of the final puzzle

mel

    Maya was doing some indepth research and stated that she discovered some really important intel regarding Loab. Howevever, something happened and we lost contact with her.
    Our operatives are currently tracing her down, but Loab seems to have caught on. Whatever the case is, we NEED to gain access to that information before she finds it and wipes it from us.
    We have all of Maya's login credentials, but she seems to have implemented her own login mechanism that we can't seem to figure out.
    Think you can help?
