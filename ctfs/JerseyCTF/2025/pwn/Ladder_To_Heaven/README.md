    You are an employee of a business that uses a Scada system. A technician came to the company, plugged something in, and entered into a debug menu on the main plc of the facility. You are tasked with entering that debug menu so the company can debug the system itself. Luckily you snagged a few screenshots of the technician's source code. What inputs should we provide power?

    Key format: jctfv{__BINARY__} where __BINARY__ is the plc inputs in sequencial order and their given on or off state. Only 0's and 1's, no spaces or anything else.
