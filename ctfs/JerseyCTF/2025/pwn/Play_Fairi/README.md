easy piece of the final puzzle

Robert Blacha

We've exfiltrated some code that RB has been using to encrypt some flags! NICC also found along with the code, a snippet of text: yjp}b{k{_vog1pnb2j31dhs1bsptln. We're sure it must be the flag but can't figure out how to undo the encryption.

Note: flag format is jctf{} for this challenge, not jctfv{}
