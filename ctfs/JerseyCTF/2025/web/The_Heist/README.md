To pull off a perfect heist you need a perfect crew. You get invited to a "secret" heist planning group that have come up with the perfect plan to break into "K!ngf1sh" bankvault. The plan was so good in fact you all decided to party the night away. Sadly, once you woke up from the party everyone on your team forgot about the plan and in the end you are own left with a crappy bar napkin with the plans scribbled on. Try to see if you can still pull off the legendary heist.
