The sun begins to set as the investigator finds a clue that will change the course of his investigation. The remnants of the thief's equations lay partially washed away in the sand. The equation that lies in the sand is "y^2 = x^3 + __x + __ mod 373". These underscores represent where a number was written but has been washed away. More notes lie in the sand as well, including a coordinate (7,39), and the number 27. The investigator knows that this coordinate and number must be used this equation somehow... but what's missing? Our detective is able to deduce more notes hidden in the underbrush just out of reach. Two scraps of paper that correspond to the two gaps in the equation drawn on the beach. The first paper has two phrases crudely scrawled, being "Fantastic Four Wanted Dead or Alive," and "Issue Number?". The second paper also has two phrases scralwed, being "Alfred's first appearence in the batcave", and "Original Price?". If the investigator can deduce these classic comic book clues to determine the missing values of this equation, they should be able to find the coordinate of the thief's lair. Flag: jctfv{(x,x)}
