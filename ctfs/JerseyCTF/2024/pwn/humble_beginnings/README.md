    In a city completely integrated with technology and living expenses through the roof, one way to get ahead is to become a netrunner.
    One day while browsing at a convenient store you notice that someone installed a crypto skimmer at the checkout counter.
    This normally would charge the person an unnoticeable amount more but luckily you have a blocker on your wallet.
    Through a slight of hand, you snatch the device.
    You wonder: Can I gain access to the crypto wallet on the device?
    Encase the found crypto address as follows jctf{ADDRESS}
