Welcome to the wacky world of graph mysteries! 🕵️‍♂️ In this challenge, you’ll be diving into a graph created with Gephi version 0.10.1. Some nodes in this graph are a bit different that makes them stand out. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to use a certain layout algorithm with the following parameters:

seed: -6166447964882867254
iterations: 200.

If you do everything right, you’ll uncover a hidden 3-character text that will make you go “Aha!”. The Flag is format is UCTF{HASH} where HASH is the MD5 hash of the revealed 3-character text. Good luck, and may the graph be with you!
