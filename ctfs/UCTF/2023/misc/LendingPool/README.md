Welcome to the LendingPool challenge! In this challenge, you'll be diving into a pool that offers flash loans of CTF tokens for free. The pool currently holds a balance of 1 million CTF tokens, while you start with nothing. However, there's no need to worry â€“ you just might have what it takes to acquire them all from the pool.
