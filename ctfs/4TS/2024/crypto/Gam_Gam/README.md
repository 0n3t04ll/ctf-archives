I love prime numbers very much, so today I decided to begin to learn how to use and implement RSA.

I have made an implementation of it.

My friends Sam and Mikaela are going to review it but you can try it too if you want.

I am a beginner so please be kind with me.

The flag is in this format: 4T${...}.
