Hello Agent,

Congratulations on finding the city in the previous photo!
We are cross-referencing this information with the rest of our data.

In the meantime, we have a second mission for you.

One of our informants has informed us that the person we are looking for recently went on vacation.
Give us the name of a location where this person has actually been, and for which we have visual confirmation.

The target's name is: Owen Perkins

There is no need to contact anyone for this challenge, thank you.

The name of the location must be in lowercase, without accents, and without spaces.

The flag is in this format: 4T${<location>}, if the solution is Central Park, the flag will be 4T${centralpark}.
