My friend gave me some shiny numbers, something to do with EVM or something like that.

He asked me to find the value that avoids self-destructing the contract.

Anyway, here what he sent me:

60075634600A5660035661DEAD020264067CCADF1E14601A57FF00

The flag is in this format: 4T${<input>}, if the solution is decimal 4919, the flag will be 4T${0x1337}.
