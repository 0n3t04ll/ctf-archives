I achieved to obtain this smart contract, but I can't understand what it does. Can you help me?
The only information that I have are the followings:

    The flag is cut in three parts and each part is emitted once.
    The first part is emitted in raw bytes.
    The second part is emitted in base85 encoding.
    The last part has to be RC4 with the decoded second part.

The flag is in this format: 4T${...}.
