Harry has a secret he does not want everyone to know. He secured it with a key with 3 parts. Find the first two keys and this will help you to the final piece - the flag.

Make sure to replace env with the environment variable and the KEY with the PAT token(binary - input).

Flag Format: flag{testflagcontents_[env:KEY]}
