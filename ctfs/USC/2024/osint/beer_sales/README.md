In August 2024, a lot of beer was sold in Orlando, Florida. But how much, exactly? Lucky for us, they left the exact number on a PDF on an open FTP server! Include the total number of gallons of beer.
ㅤ

For example: CYBORG{712931.12}
ㅤ

UPDATE: Due to the FTP server going down, you may submit the URL of the PDF as the flag.
ㅤ

For example: CYBORG{example.com/dir/report.pdf}
