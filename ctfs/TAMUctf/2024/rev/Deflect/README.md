An overworked TAMUctf dev went rogue and started leaking flags on one of our internal networks! The service was last seen online at http://10.8.0.1:1337, but we can't seem to connect to the server for some reason. We've managed to recover the server binary and some of the source code; can you figure out a way to communicate with the server?

Once you've figured it out, use the provided OpenVPN configuration file to connect to the internal network.
