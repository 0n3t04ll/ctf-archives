In the antagonistic RISC-V world, find the fracture and break into the x86_64 world.

    For convinience, we provide compiler.

    Except fracture flag, all other flags are fake flags.

    Intended difficulty is QWV::antagonism < QWV::equilibrium < QWV::fracture.
    Only QWV::antagonism's user and kernel program is different from others. (It supports uploading your own binary)
    You can solve QWV::equilibrium and QWV::antagonism independently.
    You must solve QWV::equilibrium and QWV::antagonism to solve QWV::fracture.
