Lost in the depths of an obscure, self-hosted service, you find a strange application that seems to reveal hidden addresses. But before you can make any use of it, you realize access is locked behind layers of security. Can you manipulate the program to leak critical information and take control?

A single misstep, and you might vanish into the voidâ€”unless you can find the right address and take control of execution.

Connect to the remote service and prove your skills in binary exploitation!
