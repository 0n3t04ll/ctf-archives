The shadowy organization known as "The Grid" has been intercepting classified government communications for months. Intelligence reports suggest they're using advanced mathematical techniques to secure their internal messages.

Our field agent managed to exfiltrate a partial decryption system and an encrypted message from one of their terminals. However, during the hasty escape, some components of the system were corrupted. The message is believed to contain the access codes to their central communication hub.

Your mission: Repair the decryption mechanism and recover the flag hidden within their system. Time is critical - each day The Grid remains operational puts more lives at risk.
