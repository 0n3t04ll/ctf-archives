The notorious hacker group "Phantom Protocol" has been using a sophisticated multi-layered encryption system to protect their secret messages. One of our agents managed to infiltrate their system and extracted their encryption code along with a secured message file. We need your expertise to reverse-engineer their encryption scheme and recover the flag hidden within.

The message is protected by a complex combination of RSA, AES, and XOR encryption techniques. Your mission is to carefully analyze the layers and retrieve the flag.
