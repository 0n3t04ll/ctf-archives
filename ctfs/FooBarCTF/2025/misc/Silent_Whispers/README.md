A cryptic image was intercepted from an underground hacker forumâ€”hearme.jpg. At first glance, it appears to be just an ordinary picture, but intelligence reports suggest otherwise.

The sender, known only as "GhostCipher," is infamous for embedding secret messages in plain sight. Rumors say that critical information has been hidden within this image, accessible only to those who know where to look.

Can you decode the hidden message before it vanishes into the void?
