    There's something strange about this binary file...

Hints for beginners:

    The attached file is an ELF executable for x86-64 Linux.
    Running it and entering the correct FLAG will display Correct!.
    Use tools like Ghidra or IDA Free to get an overview of the process.
    Use gdb to observe its behavior while running.
    You don’t need to fully understand every single process.
        Sometimes, it’s enough to identify the inputs and outputs.
