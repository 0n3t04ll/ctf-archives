For beginners:

    First of all, download the attachments and see the source file.
    flag.txt in the attachments is dummy! It is different from the server's one.
    What you have to do is to guess the flag... No, leak the flag. That means you have to do something SPECIAL, not just answering the quiz.
    Check the spec of suspicious functions.
