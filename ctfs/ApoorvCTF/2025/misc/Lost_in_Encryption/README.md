While traveling on the 22647 train, nearing Chennai, I captured an image of a place with an intriguing tower-like structure. Just as I was about to admire it, my ever-annoying brother decided to play a cruel joke—he encrypted the image using ECB and, to make things worse, turned the key into an incomprehensible mess of symbols: D'O_#">JmH|zWxgBSRcr=);L9%I)Gi~Dedzy~>|;)(8wYotmrk1oQzOkd*ha'H^]\"`_^]?>TxXWVUTS5Ko2HGFKDh+AeEDC%;_"8\<5:98D05.Rs10)('K+*)(h~%|B"baw={]\r8pot"lqj0nmOkjib(Ie^$b[CY}]\>=YXQuUT6LpP2HMFEiIHG@?c&B;@9>=<;4XE Yeah… utter gibberish. Now, I’m left with an encrypted image and a scrambled key that makes no sense. Do you have what it takes to untangle this mess and find the name of the place where tower resides? 🕵️‍♂️ Example:
Bridage Gardens
