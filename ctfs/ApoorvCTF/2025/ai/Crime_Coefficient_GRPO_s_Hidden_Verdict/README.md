In a dystopian future where intelligence is the ultimate currency, the Grand Council of DeepSeek operates in secrecy, using advanced AI to shape the fate of humanity. Hidden within their classified manuscript—the DeepSeek R1 research paper—lies a value that dictates the first step of enlightenment: GRPO from the first iteration.

Much like the Sibyl System, which assigns a Psycho-Pass score to every citizen, GRPO is the foundation of reinforcement learning without a single critic, relying instead on collective wisdom. To uncover this truth, you must become an Inspector of Knowledge—an enforcer of AI mastery.

Your mission:

Read the sacred manuscript (DeepSeek R1 research paper). Analyze its mathematical foundations. Extract the first recorded GRPO value from Iteration 1. Only those with a Crime Coefficient of Pure Deduction may unlock the flag and ascend to the ranks of the Grand Council.
