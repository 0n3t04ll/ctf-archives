I made a chat service where you can have CTF related conversations using ctftime MCP!

Oh but it's still in beta so I haven't actually applied MCP to the service yet and am just testing.. there shouldn't be any problems right?

    MCP server may take some time to start up (3-5 seconds)
    Challenge can be solved without Claude API key
    Use "localhost" instead of container names in the instance server
