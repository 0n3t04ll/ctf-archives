This time with an OSINT challenge

Today, I ate oats from a very famous company, and I had to go to Sedgwick for car claims. The employees told me to send my query to a number that was posted there in July 2020. After eating oats, I got reminded of the freeway on which I had an accident a few minutes before. Can you find me the number? The password for the zip file is the MD5 hash of the phone number (only numbers).
