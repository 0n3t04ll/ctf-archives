I was in the middle of downloading an important file using a peer-to-peer protocol, but something went wrong. I captured all the traffic but I'm a bit lost in this deep sea of data. Can you help me piece the file back together? https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xXuUaLjswpDGNGm0VagjSJOnpLrHcH94/view?usp=sharing
