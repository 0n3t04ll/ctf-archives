My boss is a d3ad0ne after this challenge. Well just a simple old PDF is what he said but man was he wrong about this. Well I tried my best to break through but might have changed the original PDF in the process but anyway this is more than enough hopefully. Also since I am such a stickler to Rulesets I always store whatever I find in the PDF itself, if you need them try going down the same rabbit hole I did to find them since nothing is free.
