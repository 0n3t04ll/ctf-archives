Yesterday, I was reading about Julius Caesar, the mighty Roman General and got to know that he was assassinated. Do you know in which year he was assassinated? Do you know who he was most shocked at among his assassins? If you don't, you better find out and get me the flag!

Meanwhile, I'll be on my merry way to watch Rowdy Gladiators Bleed and then I'll drink a bottle of Red wine.
