"Adi Shamir is an Israeli cryptographer and inventor. He is a co-inventor of the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm, a co-inventor of the Feige-Fiat-Shamir identification scheme, one of the inventors of differential cryptanalysis and has made numerous contributions to the fields of cryptography and computer science." ~(Wikipedia)
