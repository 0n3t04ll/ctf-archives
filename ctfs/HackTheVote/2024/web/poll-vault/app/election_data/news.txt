# Officials Warn of Potential Hacker Threats in Lewis vs. Westcott Election
Washington, D.C. — Amid rising concerns over cybersecurity, federal officials have issued a stark warning about the possibility of hackers disrupting the upcoming election between candidates Wilfred J. Lewis and Jeanette D. Westcott. According to sources, a recent cyber attack simulation uncovered vulnerabilities ranging from spoofed campaign websites to dubious emails encouraging voters to “vote twice, just to be sure.”

Lewis, in a press statement, called for “strict cybersecurity measures and maybe a few extra firewall updates,” while Westcott emphasized the need for “voter education” about spotting suspicious links. Both campaigns have hired cybersecurity experts to monitor digital threats, with Westcott jokingly adding, “If anyone emails you asking for your vote and a small donation in Bitcoin, it’s probably not me.”

In a rare bipartisan move, both candidates’ teams agreed to share information about cyber threats and pledged to remain vigilant. Meanwhile, social media is abuzz with memes, with one popular graphic featuring a hacker dressed as Uncle Sam, captioned, “I want YOU… to enable two-factor authentication!”
