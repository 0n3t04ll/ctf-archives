## Theme

This year we simulated a presidential election between Wilfred J. Lewis and Jeanette D. Westcott, two cats. After every solve, teams redirected hacked votes to one of the candidates. Westcott had a narrow lead through most of the competition with a few brief takeovers, but was ultimately hacked the winner at 157 votes, with Lewis trailing at 152.
