Last years ALLES! CTF featured a Counter Strike exploitation challenge. The holy knife of the squirrel king has been spotted in the wild. In an attempt to stop the squirrels from winning the war, the Counter Strike devs silently patched their secret weapon. But now they are striking back and reintroduced the backdoor, but the knife is too powerfull for such small hands to handle. Will you be able to help out this time? Good luck and have fun :)

You will need the Counter-Strike Global Offensive Client to solve the challenge. Additionally you need the server with an old vscript.dll. I created a minimal bundle (4.5gb) and a full bundle (11.8 gb) and a Container Savefile (13.8 gb), but I will also provide the whole remote setup source without the queue management. The Server runs on a Windows Server 2019 Machine.

Builing the whole setup from scratch will take multiple hours. If you have problems with the queue, feel free to contact me.

Make sure to read the Instructions.txt it contains some random note regarding the setup.
