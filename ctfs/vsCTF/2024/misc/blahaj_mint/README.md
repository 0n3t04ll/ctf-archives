I LOVE blahajs. I don't actually have one yet, but thankfully I can acquire some here. You should too, they're great! (This challenge is not sponsored by IKEA, blahajs are just amazing.)

Note: most of this challenge's code was taken from LACTF 2024's zerocoin, by Aplet123. The bug in question is different.
