Ransomware has struck! Can you decrypt the uber-important flag.png? Luckily for us, they seemingly forgot to delete the program they used to encrypt our files. Maybe that can help?

Note: AVX2 support on your CPU is required for this challenge. Program included only encrypts the file you specify in arguments, you don't need to worry about it encrypting your disk.
