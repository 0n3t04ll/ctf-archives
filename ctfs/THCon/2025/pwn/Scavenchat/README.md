We suspect an imminent new wave of attacks from the Xtreme Scavenger Squad on our infrastructure.

We need your help to recover sensitive information. The S.N.A.F.U has mandated you to compromise a private and offline chat server used by the criminals. The S.N.A.F.U investigation teams have managed to recover the sources of their chat server via a repository exposed on their Intranet. Recover this information at all costs.
