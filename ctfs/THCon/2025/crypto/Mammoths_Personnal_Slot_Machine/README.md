Looks like Mammoth and Zypherion (two gambling addicts in the XSS gang) have a hard time remembering their access code for the gang weaponry system. Rather than using a password manager they opted for a Slot Machine that returns their password based on luck.

We managed to find the source code for this machine and now need you to get their codes.
