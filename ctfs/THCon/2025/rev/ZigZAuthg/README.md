Viktor "Crypt" (his real name is unknown) is a master of digital camouflage. Known for his ability to manipulate hidden networks and communicate in the shadows, he has set up an ultra-secure authentication portal to protect his most sensitive information. This portal is the key to access his private networks, where he plans sabotage actions against the TH City authorities. The S.N.A.F.U. needs you to infiltrate this portal and retrieve the information needed to locate his next targets and foil his plans.
