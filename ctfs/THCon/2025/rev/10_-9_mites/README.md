In our cyberpunk world, technology has crossed unimaginable boundaries, and one of the Aurora Initiative's most secret innovations is nanomites. These tiny devices are microscopic machines capable of infiltrating complex systems at a level as deep as the processors themselves and can be used to create ultra-advanced protection mechanisms.

These nanomites can apparently detect any attempt at analysis. It would then be impossible to debug them. This level of security would be unbreakable. The SNAFU is planning on adding those to the remainging system in order to protect them from further XSS attacks, but we are not 100% sure about their efficiency. Prove that these nanomites are not infallible, by neutralizing their protection system and recovering the information hidden inside.

The sha256 of the downloaded binary is: sha256(nano_mites) = 9f02f6f15eca52f07e481a6f6f2c6b83ecb2cf42e6bc98aa45cb48a0dfbc2931
