Medium Chepycou

The Dark Backdoor members seem to be huge fans of Mozart... a bit too much since they sometimes only exchange music extracts and still seem to be able to communicate. At some point you also intercepted a message that mentionned "starting at s=1" which makes you think there is something really fishy in here. You investigate using the audio file you were able to gather.
