I am developing this app with a beautiful feature that allows users to color and choose their name and color. But... I believe something is not right.

NOTE: The bot uses a custom Firefox profile with saved credentials. For testing purposes, you will find fake credentials in the distributed sources, useful just for testing. However, the remote server uses different credentials. Brute-forcing is not an intended solution. Your goal is to find a way to leak the credentials and retrieve the flag!
