Oh boy... Things are becoming hectic and it is stressing me out.

My computer seems to be haunted as it prevents me from starting up my computer.

Thankfully, after multiple resets - it stopped. I checked the logs and it is in these weird folders named after COD maps. Can you discover which file, with its extension, and the time, keep as is, it was executed?

Flag Format: NICC{nameOfFile.extension_00:00}
