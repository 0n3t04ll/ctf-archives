forensics easy

I woke up after a night out and I'm hurting uh... everywhere... I think I left my phone at one of the bars we were at last night. Thankfully, I was able to see the last photo I took through the cloud.

Can you help me find my phone? I need to know the name of the bar and when the photo was taken.
