Remember words can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal and can also be backwards.

How many characters can a byte represent when viewed in raw hex?

The words must be continuous, ex. 0 must not appear in between characters if there is no o in the word. Words that start with a single hex char always start as follows 0x0F for example in no case should a word use random memory before. ex if the word is Fail "\x0F" + "ail" is a possibility while "\x3F" + "ail" is not. This applies for reverse order aswell.
