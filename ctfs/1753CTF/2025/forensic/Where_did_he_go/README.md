    My shy friend won’t reveal where he takes his English lessons, but I managed to grab his GPS tracker. The device uses an AT24C32 chip to store the last known position. Help me recover the location from the memory dump and find out where he's been going. Submit a flag in the format: 1753c{xxxxx_xxxxx}.
