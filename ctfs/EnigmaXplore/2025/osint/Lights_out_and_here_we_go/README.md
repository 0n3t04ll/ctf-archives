I went to see an event earlier this year and saw this car there. A British Knight was quickest at 1:15.484 to lap the circuit. I stayed at a hotel that looked like a mansion from the front, which was about 15 minutes from the place. But I forgot the name of the hotel. Can you help me remember the name?
