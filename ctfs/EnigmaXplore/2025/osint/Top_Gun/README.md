An old April '64 file is my only clue to a legendary spy plane. The stories about it are endless, but I'm trying to piece together the hard facts from its early days. The logbooks must contain the truth. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find the file and tell me: the sheer weight of its very first takeoff, specific tail number that first took its detachment past Mach 3, date and time flight 20 was programmed for.

Flag Format: EnXp{weight(inlbs)_aircraftnumber_time_date(ddmm)}

Example: If the weight was 5000 lbs, aircraft number 985 and time and date were 22:00 hours on March 5 Flag will be EnXp{5000_985_2200_0503}
