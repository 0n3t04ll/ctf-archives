To reverse, or not to reverse, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The XORs and rotations of outrageous obfuscation
Or to take arms against a sea of polynomials
And by discriminating, end them?

But soft! What byte through yonder window breaks?
It is the root, and printable is the sun!
Arise, fair root, and kill the envious non-printable
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou, her solution, art far more readable than she
