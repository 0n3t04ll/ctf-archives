Hello Team,

As discussed, we have scheduled a full-scale security test on the mail application currently in use. This particular application has been identified as the same platform exploited during the recent compromise of our multi-billion dollar corporation: Exitnction Limited, and we need to validate its security posture before allowing any further internal usage.

Our goal is to determine whether vulnerabilities still exist in our deployment. If any signs of exploitation surface or previously undocumented behavior is detected, the affected systems will be isolated immediately and a detailed follow-up assessment will be conducted.

Please ensure that all relevant services and logging aggregators remain operational during the test window and that no configuration changes are introduced until the testing phase is complete.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,

Security Team - Exitnction Limited
