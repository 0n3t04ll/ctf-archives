Our Intern got at it again! After getting heat for only writing a webserver and not a website, he decided to show us what he can do. The only question is, what skeletons are in his closet?

(This challenge shares a lot of code with http101, but the bugs / intended solution are different. It's not necessary to solve http101 to solve this one.)
