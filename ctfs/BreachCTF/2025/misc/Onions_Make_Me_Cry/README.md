I am sick of these onions. They taste horrible and also make you cry like wtf ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Then I started searching about onions and came across the onion router. Then I used the onion router to hire hitmen to kill all onions in the world. Now all onions that you eat are dead! I wanted to show my friends that I used the onion router but they don't believe me. Thankfully I was running wireshark while surfing tor. Can you help me pinpoint the ip addresses related to tor traffic? My source IP address was 10.53.6.158. So you don't have to include that.

flag format: Breach{IP1 IP2 .... IPn} That is, space separated IPs in ascending lexicographic order wrt the fullstop. x1.x2.x3.x4 < y1.y2.y3.y4 iff x1 < y1 or (x1==y1 and x2 < y2) and so on.
