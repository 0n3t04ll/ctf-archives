You’ve lost the key to your digital safe, but there’s a program available to help retrieve it. The program uses a password, but instead of comparing it directly, it encodes the input into Base64 and compares the result with a hardcoded Base64-encoded string. Your task is to figure out the correct password by analyzing how the program processes the input. Once you discover the correct password, you’ll need to format it into the correct CTF flag format to unlock the safe.

Example: QUESTCON{password_to_the_safe}
