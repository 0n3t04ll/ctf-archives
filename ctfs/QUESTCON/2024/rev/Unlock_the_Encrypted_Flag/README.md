Youâ€™ve stumbled upon a secure system that hides its flag behind an encrypted file. A Python program is provided, allowing you to check if a password can decrypt the flag. Your mission is to reverse-engineer the program to find the correct password, use it to decrypt the flag, and present the solution in the correct CTF flag format. Can you find the password and unlock the encrypted flag? (Run this Python program in the same directory as this encrypted flag.)
