“Team, focus up! Six years ago, a high-stakes flight carried critical loot that could change everything for us today. The Professor has uncovered intel suggesting that the key to unlocking this treasure lies in the departure time of that flight.” Briefing: The plane arrived at its destination six years ago, but the exact departure time from its origin remains a mystery. We’ve got an image file provided by an asset at the airport. Somewhere in that file, the answer is hidden. It could be buried within the metadata, encrypted in visual clues, or disguised through other means.Also intel suggests that there was a Golden Retriever on the plane which was reported injured. Only the sharpest minds can uncover it. Objective: Extract the departure time from the provided image. Submit the flag in the format: QUESTCON{YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM}. (YYYY-MM-DD and HH-MM are respectively the date and the updated time when the flight departed)
