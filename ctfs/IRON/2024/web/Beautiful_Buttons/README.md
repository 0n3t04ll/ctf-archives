Hey hackers! I've created a new app to showcase your design skills. This time, I've learned from my past mistakes and made it unhackable. Think you can crack it and uncover the secret?
Pro tip: Try this challenge locally first. Once your exploit works, then attempt it on the remote instance (you can thank me later!).
