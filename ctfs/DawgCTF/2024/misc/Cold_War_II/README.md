I came across some old, really cool weapon schematics. However, the document was so redacted upon being declassified that it doesn't say what the schematics are for. If I knew what they were for, it would up the cool-factor showing this in my home museum. Can you help me figure out what the weapon is called? Then, figure out who was the contractor chosen for continued development (the latter will be the flag). Thank you!
