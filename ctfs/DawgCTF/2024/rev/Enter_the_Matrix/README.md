Your friend claims they've made an unbreakable encryption scheme using the power of linear algebra! See if you can reverse engineer it. The flag is the input that produces the output "L1N4LG_1S_FUN" (without the quotes) wrapped in DawgCTF{} - for example, if you find that the input "ABCDEFGHIJKLM" (without quotes) produces "L1N4LG_1S_FUN" (without quotes), then your flag is "DawgCTF{ABCDEFGHIJKLM}" (without quotes).
