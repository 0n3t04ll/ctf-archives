Welcome, warrior. Inspired by his favorite game, For Honor, my friend made a turn-based combat simulator to familiarize people with frame data. However, the system is against you. Every move you make is just too slow. You have one secret tool: the ability to manipulate time.

Can you win the fight and retrieve the flag?
