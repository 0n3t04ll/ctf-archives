My Rayhunter has only been in operation for about 3 months, yet it's alerted 4 times! The EFF warns that Rayhunter packet captures "may contain sensitive information such as your IMSI and the unique IDs of cell towers you were near which could be used to ascertain your location at the time". Think you can figure out where I was when my Rayhunter alerted?
