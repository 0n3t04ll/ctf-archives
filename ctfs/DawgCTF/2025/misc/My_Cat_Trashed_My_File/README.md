I had a super important file open in my editor when my cat decided to take a stroll across my keyboard. He managed to smash a bunch of keys, and now the file looks like digital spaghetti. Fortunately, I had a chat with the little troublemaker and got a full confession for exactly which keys he pressed. If you can help me recover the file, I’ll be eternally grateful (and so will my cat, who’s currently on thin ice)!
