I'm trying to reverse engineer this sound bar. Maybe you can answer my questions about this?

    Which bluetooth chipset is used?
    What is wireless audio chipset used?
    What is the value of the coupling capacitor, connected to the audio module's RX antenna? Give your answer in pico-farads
    What is the pin number on the wireless audio chipset for the I2C clock signal?

Flag format clarifications: There are no square brackets in the flag, they just represent the placeholder. The capacitor value should be just a number, without any units.
