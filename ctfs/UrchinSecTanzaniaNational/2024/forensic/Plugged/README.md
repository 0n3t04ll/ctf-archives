A recent social engineering attack targeted our Receptionist at UrchinSec HQ, allowing an attacker to plug in a flash drive to one of our computers. Following this incident, our website was defaced, but we managed to capture the network packets before the website went offline.

Your task is to analyze the captured packets and identify the source of the attack to bring our website back online. Good luck!
