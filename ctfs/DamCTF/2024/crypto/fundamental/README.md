I've heard Carter-Wegman authenticators are pretty cool since they're secure without any assumptions about PRFs or anything! I know Poly1305 is a major example of one but honestly I had some trouble understanding the RFC defining it so I decided to try to implement a simplified version to see if that would help :)
