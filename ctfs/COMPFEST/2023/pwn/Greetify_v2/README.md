Because I'm feeling lonely, I created an application to greet me once again. However, I realized that I'm not the only one who is feeling lonely, so I modified it to be able to greet anyone. Nevertheless, I'm unsure about its safety. Could you please help me check it?

P.S: Due to limitations on my server, each session is restricted to a duration of 5 seconds ☹️ (to simulate this behavior, run the binary with this command: timeout 5 ./chall)
