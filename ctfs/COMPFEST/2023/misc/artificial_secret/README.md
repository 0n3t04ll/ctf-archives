I'm developing an AI Waifu chatbot startup but i'm too lazy to host my own LLMs, So i just use chatGPT API, but first i need to hide my prompt since it's my only moat, can you help me pentesting this?

the bot is online as lemond #8498 on the Discord server, but only talking in DMs. (Note: this challenge requires no automation. Please do not automate your Discord account as that is a violation of Discord's Terms of Service and may lead to the termination of your account)
