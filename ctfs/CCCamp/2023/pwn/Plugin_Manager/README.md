I'm a hacker (Kali = ❤️) with a big company enterprise background (.NET = ❤️). So I combined my skills and build a cool plugin manager.
Mono is missing Code Access Security and proper authenticode support, but I managed to verify my signed and trusted plugins anyway.
Some notes:
You will get access to a server via SSH. You can even use SCP to upload your exploit.
Use the setuid binary ./run_wrapper to start the plugin manager
