I recently visited Madras... and I got carjacked T.T

Luckily, I had a wireless OBD adapter connected to my car through which I was able to obtain the CAN log for the whole journey. It's so unfortunate that I can't make sense of the log.

    To confirm that it is mine, find the VIN for my car.
    Also, can you help me find where my car ended up?

Example flag: bi0s{1FTFW1R6XBFB08616_Eiffel Tower}
