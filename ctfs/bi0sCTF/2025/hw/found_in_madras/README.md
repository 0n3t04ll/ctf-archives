Thanks to you, I found my car

Just to be safe I want to check if the thief went above the speed limit or not. Get me the highest speed achieved by the car during the theft.

Seems like he was trying to gain access to Security level 15. Can you get me the SEED and KEY for the approved access?

(Based on the same CAN log as lost-in-madras)

Example flag: bi0s{12.23kph_DEADBEEF_CAFEBABE}

Authors: br34dcrumb, cyberhawk
Flag Format:
bi0s{maxSpeed_SEED_KEY}
