Lyra's Tavern is a simple and adventurous place for the common day adventurer to rest and get some drinks while having entertainment. She recently released a system for adventurers to share their experiences in form of chronicles. However, there has been evidence of backdoor access on the server forcing her to isolate it for maintenance. She has trusted you with the source code to find and fix any vulnerability evident within the system. Can you undertake this crucial task and assist us to give the adventurers this unique experience ? A handsome reward awaits ;)
