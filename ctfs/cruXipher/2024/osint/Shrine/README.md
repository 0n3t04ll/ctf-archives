The President of Crux Moodit has been kidnapped! His last known post included this photo, where he mentioned a nearby shrine. You must locate the shrine to find him.

The flag format is cruXipher{coordinates_of_where_the_photo_was_clicked&name_of_the_closest_shrine_in_title_case}.

For example if the coordinates are 17°32'40"N 78°34'25"E and the name is Izumo Taisha, the flag would be cruXipher{17_32_40_N_78_34_25_E&Izumo_Taisha}.
