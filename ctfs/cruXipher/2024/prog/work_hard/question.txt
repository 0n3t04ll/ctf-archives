Surely, you can solve Watermelon (https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A), the easiest competitive coding problem on Codeforces, right? 

Anyway, here's the minor twist: you can only use the SKI combinators.

Here's an example function: (S(K(S(I))))(K)

The challenge remote also supports currying, so an equivalent input would be: S (K (S I)) K 

Your expression should be a function that takes in a Church numeral as input and outputs a Church boolean that represents true if "YES" and false if "NO".

Good luck! You'll need it :)
