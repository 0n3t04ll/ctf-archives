Guitarist Bocchi wants to make it big, and is performing with her band at multiple venues to try and raise her popularity.
One such venue is a Functional Programming conference, however something strange happens here.
The audience is not interested in her music!
Desperate to try and make an impact, Bocchi tries to look around for clues, when she finds a strange sheet of paper.
This is what's written on the sheet-

GUITAR CHORDS TO IMPRESS MATHEMATICIANS
1. S x y z = (x z) (y z)
2. K x y = x
3. I x = x
4. x ( y z ) = x (y z)
TO IMPRESS THE CROWD, PLAY A PROGRESSION THAT *SUBTRACTS* OTHER PROGRESSIONS!

Bocchi's bandmate Ryo happens to be an expert at all kinds of esoteric music, and she suggests that this sheet 
might be referring to a very rare genre of music called Ski Rock.
A chord progression in Ski rock consists of S, K and I chords as well as scratches and pick scrapes, indicated by ( and ) respectively.
The sheet is asking them to perform a progression that *subtracts* two other progressions.
Ryo knows that Ski rockers have a secret number system based on these progressions, but she only knows the numbers one and zero-
zero = S K
one = (S (S (K S) K)) (S K)
Now it's up to Bocchi and her friends to figure out how to write a song with a progression that can subtract any two other progressions!

Input format-

Provide a string to the binary containing the progression like
"(S K) I"
The string can only contain whitespace, S, K, I and parentheses.
The whitespace is optional.
