burturt

Over spring break, my friend sent me this picture of a place they went to, and said it was their favorite plate to visit but it closed :(.

Where is this rock?

Answer using the coordinates of the bottom left corner of the rock, rounded to the nearest thousandth. If the coordinates were the physical location of the bruin bear statue, the flag would be lactf{34.071,-118.445}
