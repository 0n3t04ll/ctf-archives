You awake in an ancient, forgotten world, pixelated yet full of mystery. As a curious llama wandering the landscape, you notice something unusual at the heart of your journey: a chest, ancient and untouched, waiting for the one who knows its secret.
What lies inside? You feel it holds something of great importance... but the chest is locked, its password buried deep in the code of the world itself. No key and no map will help you here. Only the most skilled and patient can decipher the digital whispers hidden within.
Do you have what it takes to unlock the llama's greatest treasure?
