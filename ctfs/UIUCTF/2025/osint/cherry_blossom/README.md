I love cherry blossoms! But why is this one growing indoors?

This picture was taken inside a building. The flag is the address of the building as it appears on Google Maps. For example, if you think this photo was taken in Tokyo Tower, submit. uiuctf{4 Chome-2-8 Shibakoen, Minato City, Tokyo 105-0011, Japan}. If there are multiple addresses listed, use the Romanized version of the address.
