This challenge is inspired by TSJ CTF 2022's "virus" challenge.
I thought a virus could be even tinier, but I there's a catch: are viruses alive or dead? What separates living organisms from lifeless objects? Can viruses infect other viruses?
Note: This challenge has not been solved by the author. Have fun!
