    We received a copy of a painting today that was given to The Council.
    It seems to be a copy of The Fall of Atlantis by the artist François de Nomé.
    Scribbled on the back of the painting was a message that read:

Those who gather are found.
Those who seek are blind.
Those who see are bound.

To help hide our home,
we sought to deceive,
And told those who roam,
that we were lost to the seas.

Only when you eXamine `truth of time`
bY `LIES FROM OLD`
Will you find the map
To our home of gold.

This is probably nothing... right?
