You have been found by the OCBC (Office central de lutte contre le trafic des biens culturels - Central Office for Combating Trafficking in Cultural Property). To guarantee your freedom, you must cooperate : if you manage to provide all the information relating to the investigation, no charges will be brought against you.

Last week, there was a burglary at the Mus√©e du Louvre. The main objective of OCBC is to find stolen works before they are found on the black market.

We know from our sources that it would be a certain Willow Wool who will put the works for sale. He is one of the largest dealers in stolen art, and he does not act alone.

Your investigation will start by finding in which country he is located, in which town is the head office of his workplace, as well as the monument closest to his current place of "work".
