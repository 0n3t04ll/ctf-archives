With your team, you successfully stole the latest database from the Louvre, which is digitizing its artworks as NFTs! Unfortunately, when you connected the NFT database to your computer, it got infected with a virus, destroying all your data and the loot you thought you had stolen. Someone else must have gotten there before you, and unfortunately, you were only able to recover this corrupted image. An amateur like him must have left traces!
