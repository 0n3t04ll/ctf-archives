In a world where the machines talk in codes, Two protocols clash on their invisible roads. One speaks control, the other knows the grid, Hidden among them, a secret is hide.

Modbus whispers commands to open the gate, DNP3 listens and alters its fate. Some signals are true, some meant to deceive, Only the sharp-eyed can truly perceive.

Flags are fragmented, scattered in disguise, The real oneâ€™s elusive, behind layers of lies. Find the whispers that tell the right tale, Or be lost in the noise, destined to fail.
