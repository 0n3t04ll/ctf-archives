Since my mother kept bothering me about looking for a job, I decided to finally find one and now I work at 7 eleven. On my first day, when I arrived at the checkout counter, some weird program was asking me for a bizarre 'flag'.

Can you help me with finding this weird flag?

Note 1: Used libraries aren't modified in any way, there's no need to analyze them.

Note 2: Wrap the result string in cr3{...}
