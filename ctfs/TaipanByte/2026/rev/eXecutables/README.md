As a result of the operational activities, an executable file was obtained, which was found on the workstation of an employee of an organization engaged in the development of proprietary software.

According to the available information, this application is positioned by the developer as a "data integrity verification system," but indirect indications suggest the presence of hidden functionality. It is assumed that a marker sequence (flag) has been embedded in the program's body, confirming that this sample belongs to a specific stage of development.

Task: Analyze the provided binary file, identify the algorithm for restoring the marker sequence, and extract the flag.
