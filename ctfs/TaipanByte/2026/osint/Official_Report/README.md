#Telepathy

The enemy is using a secure information transmission channel.

The information channel is presented in the form of a digital sequence (consisting exclusively of discrete digital characters). The method of information protection is presumably a cryptographic data transformation (encryption) and/or the use of special protocols that are resistant to interception and interference. The exact algorithm and resistance are subject to determination. However, we have managed to identify the use of specialized equipment (such as "tele" or "most" equipment), which is functionally equivalent to "Ya" class trunk or subscriber encoders designed to protect communication channels.

Fortunately, we intercepted part of the message due to a mistake by their operator "@fallenskill," who incorrectly used a specialized communication channel such as "tele", "type." (".in". class)
