Few days ago, my friends and I were staying at this place, but when we arrived at the hotel, we discovered that we had been overcharged by more than 500 yuan. We wondered why the owner, who was wearing a triangular bamboo hat, had such a nasty smile on his face when we left. We decided that we would not let this go unpunished, but the problem was that we had found this place by chance, and none of us could remember its location.
