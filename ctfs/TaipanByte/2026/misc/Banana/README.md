I have this weird friend, Misha, who's totally obsessed with his pet. He's always sending me pictures of it. The cat sleeping, the cat eating, the cat just staring at the camera for no reason. It's usually funny and even kind of cute.

He recently sent another photo. At first, I didn't notice anything special, just a cat being a cat.

But then I noticed that the photo had disappeared from the chat. Luckily, I had saved it.

Now I think there was something wrong with it.
