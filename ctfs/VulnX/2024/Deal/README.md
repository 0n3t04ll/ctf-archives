Abhinandan is planning to launch a community discussion page for VULNCON. Rumors began to circulate about the malfunctioning of the original site after beta testing this new feature. A member of the dev team confirmed that he was stuck with an issue and posted about it in a dev forum. A random user named v1g1l4nt3 suggested the use of a new NSA standard cryptographic protocol to secure sensitive data. This new protocol was very fast and reliable, but suddenly, they got to know that their internal plans had been made public.

Could you help them find out what's going wrong?
