We suspect one of our top engineers has been siphoning information from our space operations. We saw some weird chatting app on his computer, so we started capturing packets between him and the chat server. He must've caught on, though, because he shut down the server and these packets are all we have. We think there's some weird encryption going on - can you help us?
