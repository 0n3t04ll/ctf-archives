A satellite has fallen from orbit, and miraculously, it is still operational. It appears to be running on a RAD-EAR-3 CPU, which is known for its reliability in space applications. The satellite has a handful of program cartridges that it can swap between (like a jukebox), and one of them is labeled "hello". Can you figure out how to run it? We need the satellite's serial number!

How to run a PEGASUS file:

runpeg <file.peg> [--debug] [--verbose] [--trace]

There are more options you can find with runpeg --help :)
