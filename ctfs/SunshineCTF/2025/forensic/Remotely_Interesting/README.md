One of our scientists was connected remotely to his Windows workstation via RDP when he suddenly saw a strange window open and then got locked out. The EDR software immediately detected the threat and performed a memory dump of the Desktop Windows Manager process, which we've been able to recover. Can you find out what the scientist saw?
