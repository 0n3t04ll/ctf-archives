Steve recently visited Peru to hike up Machu Picchu and observe its beauty. One of the pictures he took ended up on a server somewhere and Steve wants it back. He was able to capture traffic from someone else downloading it but its no where to be seen. He also stumbled across a key... Get the picture, get the flag.
