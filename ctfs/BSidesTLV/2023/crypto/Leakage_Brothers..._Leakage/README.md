Agent Alf Shalom,
Once again, we are faced with an extraordinary task that holds the fate of our country in the balance.
Our mission is to decipher a highly secure form of encryption known as AES encryption T-table implementation. This encryption was discovered on a suspicious device.
Interestingly, we came across a video featuring a sitcom where two individuals claimed to have successfully cracked this encryption by utilizing a method called "prime+prob." Although it sounds nonsensical, we are desperate and urge you to investigate further.
To assist you in this endeavor, we have provided a trace file containing 30,000 records. Each record comprises three components: plaintext, ciphertext, and S[i] (0 <= i <= 63).
S[i] represents the cache set access time measurement for cache set i after the encryption process.
Our code do just that:
prime();
AES_encrypt();
prob();
Should you manage to uncover the key, you will gain the ability to decrypt the concealed message.
Best regards,
Sheen Beit
