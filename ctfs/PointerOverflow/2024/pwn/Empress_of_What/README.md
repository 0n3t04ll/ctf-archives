The first time I successfully built a ROP chain, I thought the guy teaching me was a wizard. It felt like Prometheus personally delivering fire to light up the room. I'm not sure why. Something about it is just so cool to me. Taking little bits and pieces and assembling your own narrative. It opened up a whole new world of possibilities. It's something I'm glad I get to share with my students every year, and something I'm glad I get to share with you now. Enjoy.
