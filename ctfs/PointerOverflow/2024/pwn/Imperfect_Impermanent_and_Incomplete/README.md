All things in this universe are imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete. It's what makes many jobs necessary, including cybersecurity. Anything ever created has flaws and all things degrade, erode, and become obsolete. Our job is to patch the holes. Find the bugs. Stand watch. Clean up the mess. Tend the fire. It's a job that is endless and often thankless. I've known a lot of colleagues that got overwhelmed by it. The constant vigilance and need to absorb yourself in cybersecurity news and learning on a daily basis causes stress until they burn out.

Well, I've developed a little helper. I call itt Secret-Keeper! A program that those people can interact with for therapeutic purposes. The perfect secret-keeper that will take those stressful thoughts and store them away forever. Give it a try, but please keep in mind that it is also imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete. You might need to stumble through a learning curve.
