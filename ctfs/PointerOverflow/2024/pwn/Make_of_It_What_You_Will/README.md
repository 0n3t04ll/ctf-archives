When I was first introduced to the subject of software exploits, it always amazed me how just one tiny little mistake could lead to complete disaster. Honestly, it killed any desire I might have had to become a software engineer. Luckily for me that this morbid curiosity contributed to my future career.

As a cybersecurity professional, I'd occasionally hear colleagues talk down about programmers writing spaghetti code and not understanding secure coding practices. I feel this is the wrong attitude. The truth is that anyone can make a mistake and no one can know everything.

Let's also take a moment to appreciate just how hard of a job it is to write something functional for the 200lbs hyper-primate dumbly pushing buttons on the other end. Sometimes it seems like some users will go out of their way to provide some insane edge-case input. Ask them to enter a letter? You get a number. Or space. Or ?. Or two letters. Or an order for 50 bags of concrete. Or , , or the dreaded  (apologies for the foul language.) Or 50,000 words of copypasta. Or a Ж.

Luckily we are all super-sophisticated and extra cool cybersecurity professional people, so we're way too smart for that.
