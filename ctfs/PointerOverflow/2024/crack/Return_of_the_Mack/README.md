Sterling Archer. Code name: Duchess. Known from Berlin to Bangkok as the world's most dangerous spy. So, for us, this is... How you say? A good get. But not so good for you, Mr. Archer. Because you have information that I want. And this may be an old cliche but... We have ways of making you talk.

The message below was recovered from Sealab's master computer in 2021. We know that it is a secret transmission between Mr. Reed and Dr. P. Haze. We also know that you know the code to this private key to decrypt it. You will give us that code. No games, Archer, 6 characters, A-Z and 0-9 only.
