Consider these tales of brothers...

You've probably heard of the constellation Gemini. Most people hear that they're identical twins, but that's actually not true. One, was the son of a mortal, the other the son of Zeus. Can you imagine what it would be like to be Castor, the mortal one? If you guessed they would end up enemies, you'd be wrong.

There was another set of brothers that went by the same names. I'm speaking, of course, of the award-winning film Face/Off where Castor (played by Nicolas Cage) would be considered the leader of the two, though the brother in that case is definitely the brains of the operation. Both brothers die in that film and it seems to me they were both pretty mortal.
