It's nearly Halloween (for those countries that celebrate it.) Naturally, I'm also a bit of a fan of the horror genre so this is a great time of year for me. In this challenge, I'd like for you to track down a series of people that seem to have a similar fascination. It will require multiple steps.

First, reverse the distortion on this image. Find out who these people are, and what they have in common.

This month (October 2024) was a very special anniversary. They even held a modest event to commemorate it with a keynote presentation.

It looks incredibly interesting! The password for the archive that contains the flag is the work phone number of the speaker exactly as you find it (special characters and all.)
