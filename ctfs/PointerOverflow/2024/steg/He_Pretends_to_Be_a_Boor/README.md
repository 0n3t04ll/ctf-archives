Oh my god... Have you seen the things Prof. Johnson hsa been saying in Discord? I'm telling you, the guy is losing it. It's getting worse and worse. I would say the pressure of the contest is getting to him, but it actually started way before the contest. I remember during the summer when we were developing the challenges he burst into the lab one day waving this picture in the air and shouting, "I HAVE IT! DON'T YOU SEE!? IT'S ALL CONNECTED!!" We tried to get him to explain but he just shoved the doors open called back to us with a, "IT'S A GAME WITHIN THE GAME!!"
