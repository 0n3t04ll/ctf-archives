Honestly, I thought this one might be too easy for a 300-level challenge, but I ultimately decided to go for it. What we have here is a very simple application that actually does the work for you. When you run it, it will fetch the flag for you and let you know if it succeeded or not. It would, obviously, be much more handy if it actually displayed the flag, but that's just a little technicality for someone with your skills.
