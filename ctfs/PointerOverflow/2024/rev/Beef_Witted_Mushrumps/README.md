For this challenge, I wanted to do something in the vein of simplified memory operations in a simulated virtual machine, and I ended up with this. The binary here takes in custom bytecode, executes it, and prints the output. It won't look like much if you run it, but that doesn't matter for this type of challenge.

Wave 15 update: I've updated the binary. Same operations, but now the program decodes the first five characters of the flag before it halts.
