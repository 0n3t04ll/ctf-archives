In the dawning age of the ARPANET's gleam

A simple idea, a persistent dream

From a humble note, in '69 it came

Steve Crocker wrote it, and whispered its name

A "Request for Comments," a title so grand

To build the foundation across the land

From a simple memo, a legacy grew

To connect the world, for me and for you.
