I have written my supreme encryption algorithm in ICICLE, that's guaranteed to be memory safe now.

RIIR shall henceforth be known as RIII: Rewrite It In ICICLE.

Notes:

    You can assume that the readstr instruction correctly reads in bytes until the first 0x0a byte and does not bother with any encodings
    There are 2 ad-hoc instructions introduced, with a brief comment at the top of the file
