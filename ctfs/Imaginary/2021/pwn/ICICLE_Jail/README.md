What happens when the CEO of a law firm specializing in last wills becomes a hacker?

I set up this modified ICICLE interpreter (check the spec for new I/O instructions!) for a challenge, but I lost my credentials. I know I left them in flag.txt, but ... I put some restrictions on the interpreter so no one could steal my credentials. Can you get them for me?
