Contrary to popular belief, Shamir's secret sharing is not food. Rather, it is a cryptographic scheme that allows a secret to be split into multiple shares, such that a certain number of shares are required to reconstruct the secret. In this challenge, the dealer will give you one share and you will cooperate with other signers to sign a message using Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) on the Barreto-Naehrig curve. The Barrero-Naehrig curve is a pairing-friendly elliptic curve that is not to be confused with the Barreto-Lynn-Scott curve, also termed BLS.
