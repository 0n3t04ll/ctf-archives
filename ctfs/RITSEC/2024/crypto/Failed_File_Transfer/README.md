Hello, Investigator,

We have intercepted a transmission that was sent to the thief of Anthony’s invention. We believe it may contain information pertinent to your investigation! Additionally, the sender accidentally failed to encrypt the file with the thief's most recent provisioned key, requiring them to resend the message. I am not sure why, but the keys don’t seem all that different… There may be a vulnerability with the provisioning process. Nevertheless, we have provided you with all attempts captured in transmission and the keys used for posterity. Good luck!
