It seems like the aliens have deployed a bioweapon referred to as the "gleeb-glub" in order to weaken the population before full scale invasion. We have data that compares biometrics of humans exposed to the bioweapon and their infection status. The final column of this data is the infection status, represented with 1 as "immune" and 0 as "vulnerable." Using this data, we need to infer if members of our counter-invasion strike team are vulnerable to bioweapon.

Submit your results as a binary representation of infection vulnerability wrapped in the RS{} wrapper. For example:

Strike team member 1: vulnerable
Strike team member 2: immune
Strike team member 3: immune
Strike team member 4: vulnerable
Strike team member 5: immune
Strike team member 6: immune
Strike team member 7: vulnerable
Strike team member 8: vulnerable

Would be represented as RS{10010011}
