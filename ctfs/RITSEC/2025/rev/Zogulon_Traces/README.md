Quick!! Chase K has been abducted! He will surely be turned into a Zogulon if we don't find him in time. All I could find was this encoder for their hyperspace drive and this letter. There are likely clues everywhere, be meticulous!!

    The Zogulon Collective, has taken Chase K and transformed him into something beyond your understanding. He is lost to you now, never to return.

    With indifference,
    The Zogulon Collective
