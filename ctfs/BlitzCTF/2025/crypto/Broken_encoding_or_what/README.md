Our systems intercepted a suspicious string during a data breach, our "men" are "working" on it. but the encoding seemsâ€¦ wrong. It's not Base64, not hex, not rot13. Nothing standard.

We suspect it was "typed" under unusual conditions. Can you decipher it and retrieve the message?

Flag format: Blitz{some_text}

String: Voubz[mabmy_lr_ut_jpf_mak_qdrwbj_euhs]
