Here's our news printing service, times now! Read latest news on Times Now! And also, I was able to extract a conversation from two of the employees of Times Now: Riya: Hey, are we still on for the trip next month? Alex: Yep, absolutely! Got everything lined up. Riya: Nice. When exactly are we leaving again? Alex: Itâ€™s a Monday, early afternoon IST. Youâ€™ll get the final itinerary soon. Riya: Perfect, I just need to let work know. Alex: I was just looking at my notesâ€”our departure code is 1751634980 if you need to tag it for reference. ðŸ˜„ Riya: Departure code? That'sâ€¦ oddly specific. Alex: Haha, yeah, I like using numeric tags instead of plain dates. Makes things feel more encrypted. ðŸ˜Ž Riya: You're such a nerd, but okay. Iâ€™ll mark it down!
