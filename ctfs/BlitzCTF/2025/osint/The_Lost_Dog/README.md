A certain dog had a reputation — not for barking, but for clever dominance. On walks, he’d pull one unforgettable stunt involving a knothole, a fence, and a rival dog.

The dog belonged to someone else. While its owner was away for a day, a friend looked after it. That friend — minimalist by design — built a fast, statically typed language with systems-level access and C-like syntax.

Your goal is to identify the name of the dog.
