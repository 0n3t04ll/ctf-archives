My friend Guglielmo Del Nemico was challenged with keeping the Bologna Lighthouse running.

Although Bologna has no sea, he was determined to keep the lighthouse running and up to date, so he installed a new system to control the lighthouse remotely.

I managed to intercept some of the data exchanged between the lighthouse and the control system, but I can't make sense of it. Could you help me?
