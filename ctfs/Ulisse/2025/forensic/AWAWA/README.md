My friend Marco went to Windhoek and took a lot of pictures. He told me that he saw a lot of animals, but one of them was really strange.

Among the antelopes, birds, and other wildlife, he spotted a small, round creature perched on a rock. It had short legs, tiny ears, and beady eyes that stared right at him. At first, he thought it was just an ordinary hyrax—until it opened its mouth and, instead of a typical chirp or squeak, it said:

"AWAWA."

Marco couldn’t believe his ears. A hyrax? Saying that? He quickly snapped a picture, but by the time he looked back, the little creature had vanished. To this day, he swears it really happened.
