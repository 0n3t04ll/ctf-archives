I was going back through our service logs to verify that no one has been tampering with our defensive security measures. I generated a list of dates -- days that our firewall was proven to be online on. Alas, it seems like someone disabled our firewall for one day. I need your help to figure out what day that was. Also, the list is not in any particular order. Good luck.

The flag is in the format spartanCTF{DATE}, where DATE is in the form of YYYYMMDD.
