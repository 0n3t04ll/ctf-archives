I started writing a programming language. It’s still in progress, so you can only assign variables and print them. Oh, and a surprise functionality. NOTE: The program offers a way to gain a shell without “pwn”-ing it. Try to understand the parser and use the appropriate input. No buffer overflows or similar exploits are needed.
