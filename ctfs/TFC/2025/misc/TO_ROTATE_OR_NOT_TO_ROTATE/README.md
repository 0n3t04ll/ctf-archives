One fine evening, A had an important mission: pass a bunch of critical configurations to his good friend B.

These configs were patterns—very serious, technical things—based on segments over a neat little 3×3 grid.

But there was a problem. B was wasted.
Like, “talking to the couch and thinking it’s a microwave” level drunk. So when A carefully handed over each configuration, B took one look at it, said, “Whoa, cool spinny lines!”—and rotated it randomly. Then, to add insult to intoxication, he shuffled the order of all the patterns. Absolute chaos.

Now A has a challenge: figure out which drunkenly-distorted pattern maps back to which original configuration. If he gets it all right, B promises (in slurred speech) to give him something very important: the flag.
