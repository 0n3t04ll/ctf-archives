Okay, okay. So you were smart enough to do basic overflow huh...

Now try this challenge! I patched the shell function so it calls system instead of execve... so now your exploit shouldn't work! bwahahahahaha

Note: due to the copycat nature of this challenge, it suffers from the same bug that was in basic-overflow. see the cryptic message there for more information.
