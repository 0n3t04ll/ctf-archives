After the failure of My First App, I decided that I just can't trust user input anymore. So for my second app, I made a website that only allows pre-approved guests to access it. Oh, and I fired the old firewall guy in favor of a new one. The new one is wayyyyy better. Now I'm sure now that it's unhackable!
