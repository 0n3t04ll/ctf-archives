I really like Go Go Squid! In fact, I like it so much that I even bought the same model of cabinet that is in the series!

Can you find:

The first and last name of the designer of this cabinet?

The episode and timestamp that this cabinet first appears at all in the series on YouTube?

Flag format: uoftctf{First_Last_EpisodeNum_MM:SS}

Example: uoftctf{John_Doe_06_07:27}

Notes:

Mind the flag format/example :)

There is a 1-second fowards leniency in the timestamp (if 1:00 is correct, then 1:01 is correct)
