After the whole incident with Pokemon cards, Han Shangyan decided to buy Tong Nian shikishis autographed by famous manga artists instead. He came across this seller with autographs and sketches done by creators of Dragon Ball, Chainsaw Man, and more, all with certificates of authenticity and money-back guarantees! Surely this is too good to be true?

Turns out that this particular brand of high-quality fakes have been in production for over a decade, spanning multiple platforms, sellers, and authentication company names, though one name is always constant: the appraiser's.

What you will need to find:

First and last name of the appraiser in Japanese (how it appears on the certificate).

Email that is tied to one of the organizations that the certificate is issued by.

The year that they were reborn and started to expand the scope of their activities.

PSA did another oopsie authenticating one of these fakes, a shikishi of Draken and Mikey, which a foreigner unfortunately bought and posted. Find its certification number.

The flag format will be uoftctf{JPNAME_EMAIL_YEAR_CERT}

Example: uoftctf{山田太郎_example@example.com_9999_AA99999}

Notes:

OSINTing the author will not help, though you are free to do so.

Flag is case-sensitive.
