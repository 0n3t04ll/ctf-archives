During the Cold War, HWLabsandCo. and SRDNLen collaborated to develop a compact and fast RAM chip with many unique features. However, their efforts were not in vain, as one of their rivals had managed to steal a prototype of the chip 74LS6969 with an EEPROM of 8KB connected to it, along with a USB peripheral for connecting it to computers and an experimental datasheet that defined the mini circuit.

Some additional notes that can help you solve the challenge:

    The chip behavior is purely simulated (i.e., no real hardware is running behind).
    The datasheet contains everything you need to solve the challenge. Some pieces of information are useful for solving the challenge, while others are not. Use your intuition to find what you need, and read carefully!
    Examining the EEPROM contents is a good idea. Once you obtain it, check it carefully.
    You may need some good reverse engineering skills.

This is a remote challenge, you can connect to the service with: nc gtd.challs.srdnlen.it 42069
