Alright, we’re live, the track is rolling, the hats are sharp, the kicks are deep — but wait... something’s off. I swear, I was just improvising, but now it's like the rhythm’s... well, broken.

Did I just make a masterpiece or is this just chaos? I mean, there’s gotta be something hidden somewhere in those waves, right?

So, yeah. The sound’s kinda off, but I’m sure there’s something interesting hiding in there. Fingers crossed my DJ career doesn’t tank.
