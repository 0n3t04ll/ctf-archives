Can you escape?

Note: don't look too hard at the libkafel dependency or its usage, it is not part of the challenge, it's just an act of mercy to help you understand the seccomp policy :)

Note 2: the challenge-jail patch, despite the name, is also not part of the challenge, it's there just to make writing to /proc/self/{uid_map,gid_map} possible
