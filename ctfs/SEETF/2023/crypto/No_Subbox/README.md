Don't you hate SBOXes? They are clunky, fragile, and liable to cache timing attacks. Well, I've fixed it by removing SBOXes and replacing all operations with a non-abelian group operation! You can't do linear cryptanalysis when the cipher has nothing linear about it!
Hint: Element is (C_3^2 \times C_7) \ltimes C_4, maybe you can take quotients and do gaussian elimination?
