We've intercepted a message from the future! Unfortunately the message is protected by a password, and the software checks the password by running a GINORMOUS linear program. I guess the future just has more powerful computers, but we'd have to settle for waiting a few seconds for the result. Our team has extracted out the password checking code into a nice python script, can you recover the password?
Note: Access to a fast MILP solver isn't needed to solve this challenge.
