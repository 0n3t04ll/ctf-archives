Miscellaneous

There is a bee living in N0PStopia, named Valentine. She loves waterlilies, and lots of them are located around her beehive. However, she needs some help to find a good way to visit all of them while tralling the shortest distance, can you help her? She does not need the best path, but at least one that is good enough.

Note: Each line is the coordinates of a waterlily. The beehive is located in (0,0), and the path has to start from there and end there. Each flower has to be visited one time, but not more. When submitting, you have to send the order of flowers to be visited. For instance, if your path is to visit the 2nd flower, then the 3rd, then the 1st, you will send 0 2 3 1 0, where 0 represents the beehive. In order to be valid, your path has to have a total length of less than 1400.
