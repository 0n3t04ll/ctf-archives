We just received this sign from Foreniego, one of the wanderers of Pwntopia. He's known for drifting between Topias, never settling down, and always leaving behind a few secrets. We've been told there's something hidden in the sign he sent us, maybe it holds a clue that will help in the steps ahead. Can you uncover the truth he's hiding?
