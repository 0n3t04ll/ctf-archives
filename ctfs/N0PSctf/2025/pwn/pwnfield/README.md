We discovered that PwnTopia use their secret mine to collect shellcodium, a very rare and powerful resource! We need it too, to be able to defend N0PStopia. However, PwnTopia has put some mines in the way to the shellcodium, but we are lucky PwnTopia left their most powerful tool, a shell , sh on their way out! Can this be a secret message? Can you manage to avoid the mines and use their tool against them?
