I made a calculator! I'm using Python to do the math since I heard it's strongly typed, so my calculator should be pretty safe. Download the source code by clicking the download button above!

To connect, click the "Create" button. Install wsrx, then connect to the wss:// URL. If you're using the CLI, the output will have something like,

Hi, I am not RX, RX is here -> 127.0.0.1:<PORT>

That's wsrx's wacky way of saying you can open http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/ in your browser.
