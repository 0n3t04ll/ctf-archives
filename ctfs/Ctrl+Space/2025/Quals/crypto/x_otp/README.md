Welcome, test subject, to the Ctrl+Space Science Center for Extra-terrestrial Cartography.

We've... intercepted... a signal against the cosmic background. A message from a probe, a lonely voyager, we launched decades ago, on a one-way trip into the void. We tought it was lost. But today it began broadcasting again: a single encrypted message, a whisper from the edge of the solar system. The original encryption protocols are long gone, but we've unearthed the probe's software from a very dusty archive. Along with it, some documentation, noting that "it's encryption is simple, yet elegant: a key that shifts with the very fabric of spacetime itself. It's a symphony of ones and zeroes conducted by the clockwork of the universe."

Can you decode it?. The fate of this cosmic message, and your performance evaluation, rest in your hands. Don't disappoint us. The universe is watching.
