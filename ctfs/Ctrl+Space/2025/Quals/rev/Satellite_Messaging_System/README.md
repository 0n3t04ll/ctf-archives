We are developing a new communication protocol for our Satellite Messaging System (SMS) and deployed it on a test satellite. Someone got access to our base station and interacted with our satellite, now we know where it is but we are unable to communicate with it.

We have a capture of the communication between our base station and the satellite before the connection was lost and we think they modified some of our communication parameters, that's why we are not able to communicate with it anymore.

Can you help us to recover our satellite?
