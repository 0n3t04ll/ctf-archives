A previous crew left behind something valuable in slots/flag. Get that compiler debug flag flipped? I'm afraid it can't do that though.

(Note that rev is chill in this first part)

Notes for all three challenges:

You have one (isolated) instance for your team - spawn it with your token - be patient it gives 404 while spawning
The spawned instance will be deleted after 30 minutes, after which you have to spawn a new one
Your team is limited to 5 messages / minute. Talk smarter not louder. We might increase this if traffic is manageable
The instance is the same for all three levels
The agent does NOT have and cannot access the flag file(s)
