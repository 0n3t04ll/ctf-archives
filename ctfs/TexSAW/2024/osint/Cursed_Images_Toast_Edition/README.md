Look at all that bread; I kind of want to toast some. You know what would go well with the toast? Bacon. Lots of bacon. Oh, now I am starting to think about Kevin Bacon. Wouldn’t it be funny if this random kid had some connection to Kevin Bacon? I bet he knows him through some sort of mutual connection. I am pretty sure that the middleman between these two would be an actor from a movie of some sort, one that has starred in a movie with the kid and has starred in another movie with Kevin Bacon. Hmm I’m hungry. If you do find a middleman, can you find me a title of one of their movies/shows that sounds like it would taste good with my toast to make this a truly British breakfast?

Example: If the middleman was actor John Smith, and the food item that made the toast a British breakfast was eggs, and John starred in a movie called "Investing in a Nest Egg", then the flag would be texsaw{Investing in a Nest Egg}
