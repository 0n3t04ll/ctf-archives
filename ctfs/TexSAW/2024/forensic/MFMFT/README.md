I stole my boss' flash drive. Rumor has it that he keeps the password to the payroll database fragmented across the filenames of the contents of his USB drive. I have a segment of the Master File Table here - can you help me figure out the password? I would like to give myself a 200% raise.

Oh, this might help: [0, 10, 17, 18, 5, 6, 15, 13, 9, 16, 12, 5, 11, 1, 14, 5, 7, 6, 7, 3, 2, 2, 10, 8, 4, 7]

Wrap what you find with texsaw{}! If the password is password, enter texsaw{password}.
