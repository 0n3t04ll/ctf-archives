Iâ€™m curious about the recent market in action games. Find the total revenue generated by the 5th most revenue generating game in the Action genre in the last year (2023). Revenue is equal to the subtotal times quantity for a given order details. Some games have the same name because they're reboots of older games, make sure to group them up by id instead of by title!

Do not pay attention to discounts, the order's total_amount (that includes services), or the price of the game itself (I haggle on them anyway).
