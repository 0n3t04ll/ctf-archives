A friend of mine encouraged me to visit someone he met last year, and the visit didnâ€™t go as expected. He gave me a thumb drive and left mumbling about drip, flying monkeys, Nords, and other incomprehensible ramblings. Quite a strange man, if you ask me. After taking precautions, I opened the drive and all I found was a small binary and what I can only assume is a quiz of some kind. Maybe you can make sense of it?
