I saved this screenshot of a video I liked, but I can't remember what it was! (image.png)

All I remember is that the video was a collaboration (合作) and that it was uploaded sometime last September.

Can you find the following information about the image?

    the YouTube video id of the collaboration (v=???)
    the audio source (english song title, all lowercase)
    the visual source (romanized name of the character in the image, all lowercase, given name then surname)
    the YouTube channel of the author of the part shown in the image (@???, note that this is not the channel that uploaded the full video!)

Flag format: texsaw{1,2,3,4}

If the image was example.png, then the flag would be: texsaw{dQw4w9WgXcQ,never gonna give you up,rick astley,RickAstleyYT}
