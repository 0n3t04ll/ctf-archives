The NSA has obtained audio recordings from a notorious hacker's phone. In one recording, they hear the sound of the hacker typing on a keyboard. They believe this recording contains the password to his computer and have that attached as "password.mp3". In a separate, longer recording, they hear the hacker working at his computer, this could be useful(hint hint). Your mission is to extract the password.

The flag is the password: texsaw{password}

Hint: Only a-z is used. No spaces or special characters or numbers. You will need to wrap it yourself.
