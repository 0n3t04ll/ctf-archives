I just got off a 144 hour shift in the fields doing some tig welding. You wouldn't really understand. Anyways, I found a picture of this welding machine online. I love me some old welding machines so I'm thinking about buying it. However, it would need some parts.

Can you find me an Ebay listing selling some parts for a machine like this? I really just need to know what town the seller says they are north of so I can go pick up some parts for it.
