As a huge fan of ZITF, you want to display "ZITF" on a 14-segment display. A diagram of the 14 segments layout show how segments should be powered on.

The output should be in the format ZiTF{<bits of letter 1><bits of letter 2>...}.

For example, "ABC" becomes ZiTF{000000111101110000111000111100000000111001}.

Segments A is at position 2^13 and segment N at 2^0.
