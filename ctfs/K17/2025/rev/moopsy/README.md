mipsy is an emulator for a custom variant of the MIPS ISA. It's used at UNSW for teaching low-level computer system fundamentals. I thought I'd show it some love by writing a small flag checker for it :D. If and only if the string inputted is correct, 1 will be printed ($a0).

Note: to run, use https://github.com/insou22/mipsy (https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/mipsy/ also works)
