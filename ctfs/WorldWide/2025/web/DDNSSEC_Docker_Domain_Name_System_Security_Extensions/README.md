Check it out! I'm managing my internal Docker DNS via my regular DNS. This allows me to easily switch internal servers from my registrar's dashboard. My registrar uses DNSSEC, and I'll utilize that to make my Docker DNS secure as well. DNS synchronization can take some time, so I made this tool to test if my record points to a working internal status server.
