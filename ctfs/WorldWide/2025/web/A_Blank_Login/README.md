My database subject matter expert helped me design a login portal, so now it uses three database engines. As long as it works, right? He also gave some tips on security:

    We use bcrypt, which is one of the best password hashing algorithms out there.
    We make sure to rotate passwords on every run.
    There is even an audit trail for administrators to detect malicious activity! Do you think there is room for improvement?
