Hidden deep in the machine's encrypted logic lies the only known sequence that can restore human consciousness after the collapse: the flag.

An old man sits quietly by the terminal, tapping away in a strange language no one understands.

He doesnâ€™t say much, but one thing is certain: He holds the key.

"I don't speak the same way you do. But if you truly get me, I'll reward you."

He won't give us the flag.

Can you figure out what he wants? Maybe then, he'll let the secret slip.
