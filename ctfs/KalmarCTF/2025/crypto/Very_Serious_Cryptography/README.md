As CTF becomes more mainstream, a troubling new trend is emerging of player fanclubs becoming so large that top players and challenge authors are having their lives disrupted from the sheer volume of valentines gifts they are receiving! With some instances of the extreme valentines pressure even leading to the last minute postponement of major CTFs!?!

As such, we have decided to expand our traditional CTF valentines cards service, to provide a utility for efficiently generating meaningful, romantic gifts. We hope this will enable busy CTF players to be all set for the upcoming white day, and the huge number of return gifts they will inevitably have to send back, ensuring that no more CTF's will have to be postponed this year!
