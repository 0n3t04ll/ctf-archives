crypto rev pwn

What is better than a crypto, rev, or pwn challenge? A crypto+rev+pwn challenge series. For this second challenge in the series, the flag is contained in the binary on the remote. The binary in the handout is identical with the exception of the bytes that make up the flag, which have been replaced to create a fake flag for testing.
