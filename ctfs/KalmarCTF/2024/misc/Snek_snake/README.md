Achtungdiebash v2.0! Inspired by achtungdiebash the new and improved online multiplayer snake game is ready.

Someone keeps pwning the game, can you quickly review the ~200 lines of mostly bash and kick the cheater?

How to play: Spawn a new game by connecting to any IP in 2a01:4f8:1c1c:d3ed::/64 on port 1336. Share the connection with your friends and have them join E.g:

    nc 2a01:4f8:1c1c:d3ed:$(($RANDOM%10000)):dead:beef:abcd 1336 Follow the instruction to connect -> Click w/a/s/d and r when ready
    Share the IP with your friends and play online snake!

Can't connect? Probably IPv6 is not working on your network - see README.txt in handout for how to debug
