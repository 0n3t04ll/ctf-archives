The shadow government has been unable to extract valuable information from the rebels against the Big Bad with a wrench, and now they're asking you for help. They want you to solve the discrete logarithm problem. Unfortunately for them, you actually support the rebels in secret, so you came up with a plan:

    You ask the shadow government for a monetary reward
    You persuade the shadow government to perform a zero-knowledge proof at first, alluding to your paranoid tendencies
    You prove that you know the key
    You ask for a monetary reward immediately afterwards
    You submit the key You procure lots of popcorn and rocket propellant and get away before anyone catches on to what you're doing

You've sort of worked out all the bullets, save for the third one. The third one turned to be problematic, thoughâ€”instead of finding the key, you've managed to prove that is impossible. But does that imply you have to abolish the plan?..
