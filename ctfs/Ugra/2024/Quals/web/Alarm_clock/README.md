Our partners from Great Britain are about to start selling their Smart Alarm. We care about people's health and believe this device will cause great harm to humanity. We wish to stop the product from being released.

We have managed to get a hold on someone from smartAlarm, and they managed to steal a test access key to the web interface of Smart Alarm. They have also made a photo of the internals of the device.

We believe that the founder of smartAlarm might store some discrediting information on their laptop. Help us figure out if that's the case.
