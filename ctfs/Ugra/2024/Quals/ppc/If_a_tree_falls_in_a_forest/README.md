“Can you hear the sound of a falling tree in the forest if there’s no one around?” asked Vovan, the visibly tipsy sysadmin. Oddly enough, despite the beer, such ideas could still cross his mind. Looks like the Ballmer peak really exists…

“So can you hear it or not?” Tolik couldn’t let it go.

What is Tolik even doing at the corporate party? Who’s monitoring Grafana? Interns? Vovan’s reasoning briefly cleared for a moment, but alcohol promptly reclaimed its rightful control over his mind.

“No, of course not…" the poor programmer tried to gather his thoughts once again.

“Swear by all you hold dear? Are you sure?"

For heaven’s sake, just drop it already… Vovan almost shouted. He had loathed Tolik ever since he wouldn’t let him install Nix on the laptop. But that could be forgiven: security concerns and all, plus it’s inconvenient to administrator… But intruding on vacation? That’s too much. But a comfortable workplace is still more valuable…

“Even by prod- *hiccups* -uction…" Vovan went all in.

“Aren’t you a Nixer, though?" Tolik squinted, “You don’t like side effects, you advocate for reproducible builds. So tell me, what does launching a pure function affect?"

Well, seemingly nothing… Tolik was a strange character. Always like this with him: seems like he’s just babbling nonsense, but then he says something smart. Why is he looking at me like that… And why isn’t he keeping an eye on the servers? Hoping there won’t be any issues and he won’t get pinned down? Or is he not hoping, but being certain? So, are there juniors sitting there or just scripts?..

“Yeah, I’ve played with Nix, I did… F-function? Well, it doesn’t affect anything…"

“Uh-huh, so if you expose a function interpreter in the API without side effects and feed it an argument like your account key, nothing bad will happen?"

Vovan took another sip. Strange, strange. A dangerous type.

“It’ll be fine, why are you rambling… Bring your laptop here, let me commit your nonsense."

Tolik handed over his old Lenovo. Not getting far with that hardware… And his head was throbbing… But no worries, you can code a Lisp interpreter in your sleep. No need for a parser, yaml will do here… No need for JIT, what’s the difference, it’ll be fine anyway…

“Satisfied?” Vovan asked Tolik, but he was already gone.

Strange, strange character…
