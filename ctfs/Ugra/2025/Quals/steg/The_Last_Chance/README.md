stegano 100

— Well, I'm home. Finally! It's been a long day...

I decided to take a little rest. Broken elevator ain't joke, you know. “And what did that IF mean?” popped into my head.

— I can barely cope... Shoulda enter my apt and unwind there.

I pulled the key out of my pocket and opened the door.

— Caramba! Someone cleaned my dwellers out! Well, at least the most precious thing, my carpet, still hangs on the wall.

Why is this canvas so valuable to us?
