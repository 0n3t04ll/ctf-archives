crypto 300

Bank Bank has launched a cryptocurrency that'll shock the world! Due to funding issues, it uses an efficient centralized database instead of the blockchain. Due to RSA being irredeemably suspectible to cryptanalysis, the Zhuzhelitsa cryptosystem is used instead. Finally, BBCoins can be spent to buy flag. The public beta is open!

We've sneakily taken a photo at the BBCoin presentation.

Crack the account and buy the flag.
