Legend has it that in the basement of a building at a technological university, there is a server that has been running for a very long time and no one dares to touch it. It is said that it has never been rebooted. This is alleged to be proven by a system log.

Determine the location of this server. You donâ€™t have to be very precise though.

Keep in mind that your team only has 7 attempts to provide the coordinates.
