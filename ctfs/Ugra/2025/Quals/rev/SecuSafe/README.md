We always encrypt our communications with the applications that intelligence services likely haven't cracked. And what are they? That's right: the programs at the very bottom of Google Play search results.

Unfortunately, we lost access to our data due to breaking changes in a recent update. We have attached everything we think might be helpful. Can you help us get our flags back?
