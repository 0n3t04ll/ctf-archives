After taking three AP exams in a row I was so hungry that I walked out to try to get food. Find the coordinates of the restaurant I was looking at. Use coordinates. btctf{N,W}

Truncate so that the answer has the last remaining three digits. For example, use btctf{54.945, -111.826} if the coordinates are (54.94599730671245, -111.82651401323285)
