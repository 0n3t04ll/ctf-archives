While traveling over the holidays, I was doing some casual wardriving (as I often do). Can you use my capture to find where I went?

Note: the flag is irisctf{the_location}, where the_location is the full name of my destination location, not the street address. For example, irisctf{Washington_Monument}. Note that the flag is not case sensitive.
