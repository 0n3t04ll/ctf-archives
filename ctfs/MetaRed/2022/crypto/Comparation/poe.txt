Dresed in black cloaks
think the world is small
and the heart is huge.
Dressed in black cloaks.
Think that the tender sigh
and the scream, they disappear
in the wind is current.
Dressed in black cloaks.
The balcony was left open
and he dawn the balcony
emptied the whole sky.
oh oh yayayayay oh,
that in a black cloaks!
