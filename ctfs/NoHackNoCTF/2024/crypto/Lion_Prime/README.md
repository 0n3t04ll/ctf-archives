I just need some SLEEP!!!
Go ahead, there are some lions...
How about some wolds?

I've been hearing symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo, singing on my own
Now I can't find the key without you
