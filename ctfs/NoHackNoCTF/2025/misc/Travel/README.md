This is a photo I took some time ago, but Iâ€™ve forgotten exactly where I was when I took it. Can you figure out which building I was inside when I captured this image? Flag format: NHNC{<address_on_google_maps>} Replace all commas and spaces in the address with underscores (_). For example, if the correct address is:1 Chome-29-13 Sengoku, Bunkyo City, Tokyo 112-0011, Japan,Then the correct flag would be:NHNC{1_Chome-29-13_Sengoku_Bunkyo City_Tokyo_112-0011_Japan}
