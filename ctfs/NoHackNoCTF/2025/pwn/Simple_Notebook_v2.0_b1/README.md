We've just fixed an integer overflow and introduced some exciting new features -- you can securely save your work offline and upload previous sessions now. We use server-side, 256-bit AES encryption and your secret password to keep your data confidential and free from offline password cracking. Though this beta version is still being tested, you are welcome to preview it now!
