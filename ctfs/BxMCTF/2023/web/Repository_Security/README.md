# Login Extension for Flask

The simplest way to add login to flask!

## How it works

First, install it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/flask_simplelogin/):

```console
$ pip install flask_simplelogin
```

Then, use it in your app:

```python
from flask import Flask
from example.flask_simplelogin import SimpleLogin

app = Flask(__name__)
SimpleLogin(app)
```

## **That's it!**

Now you have `/login` and `/logout` routes in your application.

The username defaults to `admin` and the password defaults to `secret` â€” yeah that's not clever, check the [docs](https://flask-simple-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) to see how to configure it properly!

# Usage

Run with:

```bash
python app.py
```

The `manage.py`

A complete application using Flask factories, click commands and storing
passwords encrypted in a json file `users.json` which you can easily take
as example to replace with your own database manager.

> NOTE: this example is not meant for production use as writing in a json file
> is suitable only for single access. Go with MongoDb, TinyDB or other SGDB.

Run with:

```bash
python manage.py
```

Create new user:

```bash
python manage.py adduser
```

Run the server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
