My favorite social media platform, Prorope, has overhauled their username system and now supports prefixes and suffixes! Isn't that so cool?

For one, I know that I would really love to be the !! JW !!, so I made a website to preview these username changes.

Note: the flag is in an environment variable called FLAG
