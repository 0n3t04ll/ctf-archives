You're at the bank with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about your empty bank balance
'Cause she doesn't get your money like I do

Unfortunately, you only have $16 left in your bank account. Feeling too poor to even sing along to Taylor Swift in the car (after all, the radio needs power, which costs money), you wonder, if only there was a way for me to pull off a bank heist and get a hundred thousand dollarsâ€¦
