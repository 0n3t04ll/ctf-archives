Last year (in an unrelated contest), I made a Python password checker that had way too many solutions. To be fair, it was on me for using eval without sanitizing input or anything, but like, cmon, can we not just trust people nowadays? What happened to the days of leaving your front door unlocked?

Anyways, I made it completely foolproof this time: no flag variable, no more printing, heck, no builtins at all!

Surely it's unbreakable nowâ€¦right?

This problem was inspired by an online judge platform that shall not be named.
