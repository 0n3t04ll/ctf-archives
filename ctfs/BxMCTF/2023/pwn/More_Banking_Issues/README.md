BxMCTF has now created some ABMs (Automated Banking Machines), using the brand new technology of the heap from the 1950s (even though it's fundamentally incompatible from their current implementation in pwn1, but whatever)!

Despite having 0 documentation and not even commenting any of their code, they told a brand new 1B intern to implement this system.

The intern hired you to audit their code so that they don't get fired and made liable for company losses. Can you find any vulnerabilities?
