Ryzon's ICS5U teacher recently got hacked by an Anonymous user, and he cannot log in to his computer! The Anonymous user, being the evil individual they are, formatted the password into four distinct integers. Not being completely merciless, however, the Anonymous user gives you two hints, one in the form of a text file and the other in the form of a program, that will help guide you into knowing what the four integers are.

Ryzon, who is currently failing the ICS5U course, knew that this was the perfect opportunity to convince his teacher to pass him, only if he unlocks his PCâ€¦
