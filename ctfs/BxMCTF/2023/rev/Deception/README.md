One day, one of Ryzon's imaginary friends, Claudio, mysteriously gives him a text file and says that there is secret information within the file that is impossible to retrieve! So much so that he promises to give Ryzon $1,000,000 if he manages to get the info.

However, Claudio is a humongous troll and tries to deceive Ryzon as much as possible by spamming a bunch of useless information.

Can you help Ryzon retrieve the top-secret information? He promises to share the prize money with you if you do!
