"In the land of echoes, where whispers roam, A tale of clues, finds its home. Laughter and tears, merge in the air, In echoes' parody, stories flare. Footsteps of past, meet those of now, In the echo's chamber, they take a bow. Love's sweet whispers, pain's bitter cry, All in the echoes, they do lie. Listen close, and you will find, Clues and whispers, intertwined. In the echo's game, secrets unfurl, A world of mysteries, for all to swirl."
