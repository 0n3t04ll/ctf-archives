So you have a very security-concerned friend who does not like any smartphones and only uses his original Nokia phone. He constantly receives some secret SMS, but you've never figured out what he got, as when he showed you his messages, no new texts were there. One day, you decide to whip out our old HackRF and sniff all GSM traffic until your friend receives another SMS. After some fiddling with the signals, you recover three SMS messages, which you'll find attached. Can you extract the secret message sent to your friend?
