This used to be a simple pwn challenge. But someone patched it and the win function doesn't print the flag anymore, can you still get it? If this is the first time doing binary exploitation, this challenge might feel a bit overwhelming. But don't worry, I have attached the first challenge from last year and a README for it. If you solve that one, you should be able to solve this one as well with a bit of tinkering. If you feel stuck, feel free to ask for help in the discord server.
