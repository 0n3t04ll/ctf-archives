In this challenge, we have a webpage under construction at this link. The flag is hidden directly inside one of the files shared by the web server.

The name of the file is one of those listed in the Discovery directory's wordlist, specifically in this link Whenever the flag is found and sent as a response it will immediately change to a new file choosen at random.

Automatic tools like Gobuster cannot be used. If you use them, the system might troll you.

Will you be able to find the flag?
