Misc Easy

These Silly-Willies are getting up to some antics, but where? What Latitude and Longitude is this photo taken? (Answer with 5 decimal places, no rounding)

Coordinates should be in decimal degrees: the flag should look like sillyCTF{xx.xxxxx,xx.xxxxx} where x is an integer. Coordinates may be negative or positive.
