Misc Insane

Aliens are real! In 2120, scientists at ESA discovered an advanced civilization on TRAPPIST-1e -- and communicated with it. The Trappists are geometry-loving, cross-eyed folks who like to encode their messages inside puzzles. Yesterday, they transmitted us a bizarre-looking image they claim contains the MEANING OF LIFE. WOAH. Nobody can figure out the letter string hidden within. All we know is it's lexicographically ordered. Can you help us?
