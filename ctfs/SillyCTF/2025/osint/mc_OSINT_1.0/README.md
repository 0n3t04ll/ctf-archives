I'm afraid to go outside my house, because the world's really strange! Who came up with this worldtype originally?

This is asking about the creator of the specific worldtype, not the game as a whole.

Wrap your answer in sillyCTF{} with no spaces or capitalization. For example, if the person is Steve Blockman, the flag would be sillyCTF{steveblockman}
