In the limit, it’s a chip company, but there’s a lot of intermediates along the way. We only use two operations. Where does Haskell4J come in?
Well, this challenge has nothing to do with chips (not even with Haskell). However, we only use TWO BASIC OPERATIONS, so you can run it on any chip, if you want.
The program outputs: 57 101 114 32 62 63 50 53 34 103 117 13 48 10 33 38 26 95 7 113 116 64 20 1 39 37 89 7 93 88 82 84 71 31 26 69 6 5 3 31 31 2 6 94 3 92 120 126 0 89 27 70 4 90 49 111 1 94 2 21 3
