![](https://logos-world.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Pirate-Bay-Symbol.png =40x25) My friend told me about this nice website where you can download music (legally of course) without having to deal with this annoying green website. Something is wrong with the song I downloaded though and I can't find the support hotline. Since he is not working at the factory with me anymore and his boss is keeping him busy with programming some weird game, I also can't ask him for help. If anybody can fix this, I am willing to give out a big award! ![](https://logos-world.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Pirate-Bay-Symbol.png =40x25)
