My boss tasked me with programming a connect4 game and I was allowed to use any language. At first, I was stoked. Finally, I could try out this new rustlang that everybody was talking about. But with time passing, he kept setting shorter deadlines that I couldn't fulfill. Yesterday, he shouted at me that we have to publish now. Nothing is working and I even had to turn my back on rust and write the client in C, so he wouldn't fire me. I only had time for a few safety measures. He also kept mumbling about the cloud, therefore the client also runs on a server. Nothing is working, nothing makes sense... I need somebody to find a way to play this shit game anyway. I need this job badly, so I don't have to go back to my old job at the factory. Please help me.
