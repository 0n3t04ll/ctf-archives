Long before cryptography became a playground of prime numbers and elliptic curves, it was more like a craft project 🎨. People would shuffle letters, invent quirky alphabets, or scribble secret notes that only their friends could read. It was messy, creative, and surprisingly fun.

This challenge is a little trip back to that era. What you’re staring at once began as a few plain paragraphs of English text 📖. Nothing fancy, just words on a page. But now those words carry a secret, tucked away like a treasure waiting to be found 🏴.

Unfortunately, the encryption/decryption key is forever lost, hope that's not too much of an inconvenience...

Can you put yourself in the shoes of an old-school codebreaker and bring the hidden message back to life?
