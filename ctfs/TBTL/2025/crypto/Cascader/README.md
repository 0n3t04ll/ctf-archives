Just found this super cool key exchange protocol while scrolling Hacker News between meetings ☕️⚡️🧠

It's based on some clean recurrence math — none of that dinosaur-era number theory stuff 🦕 finally, crypto that doesn't look like it was invented in the 70s 📟

It came with a working implementation too, so i plugged it right in and shipped to prod 🚀🛠️

A few people said I should’ve used something more “proven” 🔒🤷‍♂️ but honestly... this just feels right ✨

Anyway, i packaged it into a challenge. Curious to see what the skeptics say now 😏🔍
