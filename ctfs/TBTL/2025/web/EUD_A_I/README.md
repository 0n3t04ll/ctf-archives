I've been working on an EUDI showcase which I'll present at the next big conference. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º

Basically, I've taken the Architecture and Reference Framework and fed it to a popular LLM ðŸ™ˆ

I repeatedly asked the LLM to summarize the standards until it spit out something I could finally understand. The LLM's implementation should be secure... If you want to convince me it isn't, find Bill Roscoe's flag! ðŸš©

Note: To prevent you from guessing the flag, you'll have only 25 submissions available, use them wisely. The flag format is FortID{<32_hex_characters>}
