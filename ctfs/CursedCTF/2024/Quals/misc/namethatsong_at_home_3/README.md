nope

me: can i have ██████ soundtrack? mom: we have ██████ soundtrack at home ██████ soundtrack at home: find the english translation of the song name in normal flag format. remove all symbols and replace spaces with underscores. if the song name was "Larry's -> Silly !! Song", write "cursed{larryssillysong}". these should be easy points! good luck!
