I wrote this super cool emulator
Above all the others, I'm quite sure it is greater
There are many bells and whistles galore
The quality of which I know you'll adore
Coolest of all are all the syscalls
The implementations of which are surely high-qual
Because of this I would stipulate
That from this emulator there is no escape
