During a routine scan, Nova uncovered a forgotten vault deep in the cloud—part of an old project codenamed ima. Buried in metadata logs, she spotted a long string: 07cc411e2ef775215. Curious, she traced it back to an archive.

Inside was a single note: “To unlock the sky, speak the words: CloudCTF2025!”

Nova whispered them into the terminal. The vault opened.

Some doors were never meant to close.
