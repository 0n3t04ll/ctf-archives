Baburao was an AWS Administrator who spent most of his time staring outside the office window in downtown Frankfurt and wondering "am i not worthy?". He hated his job. His only way out was to quit and move on to a different organization that would perhaps let him spread his wings and fly into the clouds.

So, one day he moved all his sensitive information to an AMI, changed the permission to public and left, so that he could extract the contents later, from his new office across the city. He thought this would not raise any red flags, oh but he thought wrong, didn't he?

Can you find the AMI and check what was the data Hoffman was planning to steal?

Note: The flag format for this challenge is BMCTF{flag}
