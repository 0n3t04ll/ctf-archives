We intercepted an encrypted incoming transmission at a rogue employee's workstation. We suspect that there is a second troublemaker working alongside them. There is a high chance that secret data has been exfiltrated during the recorded communication. We will provide you with the communication transcript of ciphertext and IV pairs. The suspect likely used AES-128 with a common block cipher mode. Additionally, we have provided you with our format for inter-agency communication, we expect the original messages to have included 1 TRANSMISSION STATUS: BEGIN BLOCK line for every 4 lines of 32 byte messages. Check the format file for an example.
