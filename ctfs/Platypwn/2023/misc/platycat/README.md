Your new colleague Doris operates a fileshare on DDD activity info. You requested the password for it a while ago, and today you received her answer:

    Hello dear!
    I'm terribly xorry that this took me so long! I've attached the password, but for security reasons I've encrypted it with my personal key. Oh, and there's platypus pictures! I've also encrypted them for fun :)

    Since I can only append one file, I've joined them with a revolutionary tool to join cute animal pictures (it came preinstalled on my computer!). And of course I also can't send you the key ;)

    Best, Doris

Can you find the password for Doris' fileshare?
