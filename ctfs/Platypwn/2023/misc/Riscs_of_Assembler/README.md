The Digitalization Department of Dasdorf got some interesting information: The daring digitization delinquents prefer writing their exploits in RISC-V assembler! They even operate their own web platform to train their new members. This could be a chance for Dasdorf! For sure, also the daring digitization delinquents have to make a mistake sometimes. Maybe, this platform allows you to regain some information stolen by the daring digitization delinquents...
