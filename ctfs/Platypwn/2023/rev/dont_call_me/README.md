Meet the Dasdorf super secure OS (DAS SOS)! In our Digitisation Department, we are not using this Silicon Valley OSs... nope! We use our own stuff. And we're very proud. Of course, we took the OS-101 course before writing our operating system.

This challenge requires reverse engineering the given software. Familiarize yourself with the boot process of a virtual x86 machine. We recommend using Ghidra to get an insight into the operating system. Play around with user programs.
