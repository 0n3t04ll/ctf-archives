Last Monday, my colleague had the weirdest computer problems. First, his new 10 TB USB flash drive did not work at all at the work PC. Next, when he came back from a coffee break, his screen showed a cryptic message to pay someone money to get back files, with red blinking skulls. Even after a restart, there was no way he could work on our spreadsheets. The IT people said they want to give him a new computer and saved all his settings to speed up the process, but our crucial spreadsheets are still behind schedule.

Can find out what happened to the old system?
