This picture was taken on a sunny Saturday sightseeing trip earlier this year. Do you know when exactly?

The flag contains information about day, month, hour (24-hour clock), and minute rounded down to five full minutes of the local time when the picture was taken. Additionally, there is the sun’s altitude and azimuth at that time, both given in radians and rounded down to two decimal places.

If the picture was taken on March 14, 20:17:25 local time with the sun’s altitude of 1.4142 rad and azimuth of 3.1415 rad, the flag would look like this: PP{03-14_20-15_1-41_3-14}
