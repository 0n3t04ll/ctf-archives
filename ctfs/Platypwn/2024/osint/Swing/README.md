I’ve been hiking on a real premium trail lately and found this swing. Can you tell me where it is?

The flag consists of latitude and longitude coordinates of the swing’s location rounded to three decimal places, the name of the street (omitting any potential spaces, punctuation and diacritics), and the name of the town it belongs to.

Regarding flag format, consider this example for one of our university’s buildings: PP{N52-516_E13-377_augustbebelstrasse_potsdam}
