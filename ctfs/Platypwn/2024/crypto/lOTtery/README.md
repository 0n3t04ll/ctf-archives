Fresh from an introductory lecture on MPC, I set out to make the world a better place using privacy-enhancing technologies.

The first place to start is, of course, my professional gambling career. I plan to make a fortune in the 6/49 lottery using the groundbreaking betting techniques I developed while not paying attention in my statistics class last semester. However, I am winning significantly less than my irrefutable analysis predicts.

I have a feeling that the lottery managers are onto me. They know I can beat them in a fair and random game, so they intercept my tickets and manipulate their drawings to put me at a disadvantage.

If they were really honest, they would not be afraid to use my newly developed lottery system instead. It uses oblivious transfer to let me buy tickets without them knowing what numbers I have chosen. Only when they reveal the winning combination I do show them my ticket, but thanks to crypto, I cannot cheat either. At least not to the system, my strategy is of course still brilliant.
