I've encrypted my secret message with RSA.

Easy stuff, right?

Well, I'm not giving you the key outright...

I've hidden it in a haystack!

Sure, a key is not a needle, and this haystack is not that big.

It shouldn't take more than 10' to find it, if you have an half-decent metal detector.

Good luck!
