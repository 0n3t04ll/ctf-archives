I've always had a crush on Feistel networks: they're elegant, reliable, and the backbone of modern cryptography! I've built this Feistel network to demonstrate how we can create a super secure implementation with a special feature: a shortcut that makes encryption lightning fast!

My friends warned me that taking shortcuts in crypto is dangerous, but what do they know? The cipher still looks completely random, so it must be secure...right?
