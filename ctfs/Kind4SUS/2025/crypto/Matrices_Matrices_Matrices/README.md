The future is here! This incredible Learning With Errors system makes quantum computing no longer a threat to cryptography! This cryptosystem is so robust that any parameter selection guarantees sufficient security for generating safe and reliable key-pairs. What? You think I'm exaggerating? Well, if you're so confident, try to recover the secret vector of this key. I'm sure you'll come back begging for mercy.
