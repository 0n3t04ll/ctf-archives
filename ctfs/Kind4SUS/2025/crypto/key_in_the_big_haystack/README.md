Have you found the previous key? Well done!

(If not, solve "key in the haystack" first.)

Now the haystack is bigger: you'll need a good metal detector :D

I know a quite sophisticated trick that recovers the key in seconds, from the small haystack.

The same trick works now, but requires a few hours.

Don't despair: with a good idea you'll find it in less than 5'.
