Our sysadmin used to stare into the void, until the void started to stare back at them.

Then they got mad...ly in love!

Now the root user in the server is revealing all our secrets to the void:

yes 'cat flag.txt' > /dev/null

Fortunately, you have access to the system as an unprivileged user.

Unfortunately, you are crazy too.

Be careful: you may hallucinate the right command to recover the flag!

Unfortunately, the computer is crazy too: every answer is scrambled.

Fortunately, it is crazy just as you are!
