Team Galactic stole my Pok√©mon.

When I went to file a report, they asked me for their names, but I forgot them.

Could you help me recover them?

Note: The flag is not in the standard format when you have found the names (nicknames) separate them with an underscore and put them inside KSUS{}, the save file was created using MelonDS.
