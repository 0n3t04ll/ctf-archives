I just moved into this place, and my neighbor is… weird. A mad scientist—wild hair, crazy eyes, always muttering about “the perfect game for my plan.” The other night, I saw a strange chessboard through his window, pieces arranged in a way that felt... wrong. The board was conquered by white and the game was weirdly verrry loong. but I think he's hiding something. Something big.
