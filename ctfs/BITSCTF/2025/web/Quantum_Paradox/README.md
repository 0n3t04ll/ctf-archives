Breach a quantum-secured darknet exchange by exploiting vulnerabilities in:

    Quantum Handshake Protocol
    Temporal Authentication
    Quantum WASM Processor

Flag Format: BITSCTF{...}
Challenge Details

    Endpoints:
        POST /qchannel - Initialize quantum channel
        GET /entangle - Generate authentication token
        POST /qproc - Process quantum WASM modules
        GET /vault/{something} - Restricted flag storage

Hints

    "Quantum protocols often reuse known entropy seeds for initialization."
    "Not all algorithms validate their cryptographic claims."
    "Memory superposition collapses at fixed boundaries."
