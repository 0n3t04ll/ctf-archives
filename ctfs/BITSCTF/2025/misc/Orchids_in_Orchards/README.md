Samuel is a retired Radio Jockey who used to host shows and bring energy to parties at the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. Even in retirement, Samuel has an odd obsession with the first letters of thingsâ€”words, names, places etc.

One day, while sorting through old belongings, he stumbles upon a mysterious note with strange codes written on it. His curiosity is piqued, but solving this mystery might require a sharper mind. Can you help him tune in to uncover the flag?

NOTE: Wrap the flag in BITSCTF{} and enter only lowercase values.
