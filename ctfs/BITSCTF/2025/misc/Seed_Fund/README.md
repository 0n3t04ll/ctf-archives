blockchain

BITS is known for its startup culture & we have one Angel Investor willing to invest in one such new age blockchain startup. Your startup needs at least 100 ether of funding to be the next big story! But, our Angel Investor only provides a maximum of 21 ether funding that too on a considerable amount of equity. He may even chose to buy the whole company but that ain't happening to you in my opinion ;)

Can you secure your dream funding & shake the markets?
