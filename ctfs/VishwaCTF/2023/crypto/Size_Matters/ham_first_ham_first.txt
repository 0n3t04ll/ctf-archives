ASCII, in full American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a standard data-encoding format for electronic communication 
between computers. ASCII assigns standard numeric values to letters, numerals, punctuation marks, and 
other characters used in computers.When i was developing something i was in need to add functionality to my keyboard input->check the

ASCII uses seven-digit binary numbers—i.e., numbers consisting of various sequences of 0’s and 1’s. Since there are 128 different possible 
combinations of seven 0’s and 1’s, the code can represent 128 different characters.
