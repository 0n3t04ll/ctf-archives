Please identify where this location was taken.

However, please answer in the following flag format: CPCTF{XY}
where X and Y are the decimal values ​​of latitude and longitude, respectively, converted into integers using the following steps.

1. Round the latitude and longitude to the fifth decimal place.
2. Multiply the result by 10,000 and let the result be X and Y.
Example
If the coordinates of the shooting location are latitude 35.6054818... and longitude 139.6840248...,
rounding 35.6054818 to the fifth decimal place and multiplying it by 10,000 gives X = 356055, and
rounding 139.6840248 to the fifth decimal place gives 139.6840, so Y = 1396840. Therefore
, the flag is CPCTF{356055-1396840}.
