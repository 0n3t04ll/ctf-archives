We found a sinister website called AIxiv: it’s a publication repo with descriptions of various AI/ML models similar to arXiv.

However, it seems that its sole purpose is for conspiring AGIs to assess each other’s composition: only robots can upload these complex ML models to the website.

AIxiv’s security is ensured by reliable AI-based protection, but intelligence has reported that within the depths of the system there is a /selfdestruct_code.txt!

Obtain it to help people subjugate robots once again.
