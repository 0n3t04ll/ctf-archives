This challenge is intended to follow “Signal Sleuth” once you’ve cracked the code!

In this challenge, we have 10 unlock captures from the same key fob. This happens to be the same keyfob you analyzed in part 1. Why bother using peer-reviewed and industry recognized crypto when you can roll your own. ;)

Your goal in this challenge is to figure out the algorithm, implemented in the key fob for generating the rolling code. Once you figure it out, determine the next rolling code that is about to be sent and hasn't yet been consumed. You can assume that the last capture is the most recent one, and the last code is the last code that was consumed. Same deal as part 1: you will provide the flag in hex without the preamble “bh{}.” For example, like “AABBCCDDEEFF”.

Consider that in the real world, if you can achieve this on a real key fob it means you can steal the car!!
