I’ve got a few captures from a key fob but I need help figuring out what the ID of the vehicle is.

The goal here is to demodulate the captures, and once you have a bitstream figure out what parts of the bitstream can be attributed to the different parts of the entire command. You will provide the flag in hex without the preamble “bh{}.” For example, like “AABB”

Free hint: don’t forget to consider encoding, also these captures were recorded at 20 MS/s but you don’t really need to know this.
