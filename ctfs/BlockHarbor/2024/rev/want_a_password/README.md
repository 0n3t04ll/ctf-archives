An automotive dealership has developed a custom tool to generate passwords for all their accounts and to encrypt sensitive files. Unfortunately, the password for a critical ZIP file containing sensitive dealership information was lost. The dealership knows that the password was generated sometime between Thursday, June 27, 2024, 11:37:29 AM and 11:37:45 AM. With a few workarounds they figured out that the tool generated the password 'GiGMQKEinc' at 11:37:29 AM and the password 'QR36qTdbHM' at 11:37:45 AM and it seemed that those were the incorrect passwords to the zip file.

Can you help this dealership to recover the password and decrypt the zip file?
