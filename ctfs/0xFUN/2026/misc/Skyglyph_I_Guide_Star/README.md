Your star-tracker is spitting out centroid blobs… but the sky is warped. In tracker_dump.csv, a handful of detections are labeled with real RA/Dec - use them as guide stars to calibrate the camera (tangent-plane projection + mild radial distortion). Once you map everything back into sky-plane coordinates, a hidden message appears.
