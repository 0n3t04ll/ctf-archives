Stick

No more hand-holding. You now have 4 noisy frames of detections and a full catalog. You get a rough pointing seed for frame1 only, and that’s it. Plate-solve each frame (pose + radial distortion), recover the correct star IDs, then decrypt one part of the flag per frame. Wrong matches don’t “almost work”, AEAD authentication will fail.
