Stick

Three images. Three fragments. Each one points to a place, and each one carries a different kind of weight.

Temptation shows up first. Something made to catch the eye and test what people choose to value. Stone comes next. A name important enough to be carved and left behind when everything else moves on. Silence comes last. The silence of a legend. They say the region’s elder once made a deal with the devil, and the land has been quiet about it ever since.

Find the Latvian place name (pilsēta/ciems) for each image and submit the flag:

0xfun{City1_City2_City3}

Names only. Latvian spelling and diacritics required.
