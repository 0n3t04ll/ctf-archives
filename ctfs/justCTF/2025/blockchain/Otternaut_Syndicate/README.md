The launch is a success — barely. The Otternaut escapes the crash zone and lands near a Council outpost rumored to hold a Forbidden Fuel Cell, the only known energy source powerful enough to trigger a warp jump and leave Cryon-7 for good. But there's a problem: the cell is guarded, and the only way in is through corruption. Bribing a Council guard comes at a steep cost — and the Otternaut has no funds left. Desperate, they turn to the Cryon Underbank, a shadowy lender of last resort. A loan is granted, but with strict terms: every borrowed Cryon Credit must be returned. No exceptions. No excuses.
