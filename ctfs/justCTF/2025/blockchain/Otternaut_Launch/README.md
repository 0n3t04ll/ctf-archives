BLOCKCHAIN, BABY

Stranded on the frozen wastelands of Cryon-7, the Otternaut awakens in a half-buried, decades-old emergency capsule. Life support is failing, communications are dead, and the orbiting relay has gone silent. The only hope lies in restoring the capsule's core systems. But the capsule was never meant to launch solo — it was built to be assembled piece by piece in a controlled lab, not reconstructed by paw in the wreckage of a crash site. Armed with salvaged tools, jury-rigged firmware, and sheer determination, the Otternaut begins to assemble the launch capsule manually, installing exo-frame parts, calibrating avionics, and overriding water-efficiency protocols. If every component fits — and every test passes — the capsule might just ignite. But the odds are thin. And Cryon-7 is getting colder.
