PIG SEK@1
BLOCKCHAIN

With the guard corrupted and the vault exposed, the Otternaut finally secures the Forbidden Fuel Cell â€” the last piece needed to escape Cryon-7. But the Council was prepared. The moment the fuel cell is removed, a failsafe triggers: the Otternaut's address is automatically blacklisted, and the fuel becomes completely inert. It can't be transferred. It can't be installed. It can't be used. Unless... The launch capsule is ready. The stars are waiting. But first, the Otternaut must outwit the system that was designed to stop them.
