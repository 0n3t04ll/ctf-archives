A new video upload platform opens its doors! It's promising and a lot of investors are part of the project!

The admin of the platform has uploaded a presentation video which presents a lot of tips and advices to start and progress quickly on the platform.

Unfortunately, you are not an investor...

The admin of the platform is very trendy, and the code of the platform is open-source.

Find a way to watch the admin's video!
