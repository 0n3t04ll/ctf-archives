Something’s wrong with this record player - the music doesn’t sound quite right.
Your mission is to fix it. Don’t worry though, the technology here is pretty simple.

Right below the PLAY button, you’ll find two switches:

One controls the direction the record spins
The other keeps the pitch steady
Chances are, both of these switches are broken.

Good luck!
