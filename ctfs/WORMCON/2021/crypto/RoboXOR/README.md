Rick got a robot named "XORius" as a gift by his parents which activates with a key, in user manual it was written - "we suggest you to use your name is X factor for ROBO ^_^" so Rick followed the user manual, his bot was working fine and now started saying "2506110631060d103c5a15582036045b3c075734640015580d10531e0d1c134a2f"

But now Rick has fear of his parents and he wants your help to understand his ROBO
