By popular demand of a singular person, we have partnered with Let's Encrypt and obtained a limited number of personalized participation certificates. Available as long as supplies last. Out of fairness to other teams, please only download this certificate <b>once</b> per team.<br/><br/>
The flag for this challenge is the very last sentence of this certificate, in full (includes capitalization and punctuation).<br/>
