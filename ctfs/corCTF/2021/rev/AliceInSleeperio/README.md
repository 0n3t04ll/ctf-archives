Our dear beloved Alice has fallen into the deep sleep universe known as Sleeperio, where nothing makes sense. Let's make sense of the sense-less and pull Alice out of this nightmare once and for all! Note: Your AV might not be happy about this file.

Don't reinvent the wheel, everything you need is in the clues ;)

Note - the author mentioned the following as a hint:

Themida is winlicense
Oreans Technologies sells CodeVirtualizer (their VM), Themida (their VM and packer) and WinLicense (their VM, packer and license software)
If an unpacker works for winlicense, it works for themida
Notice however that there are 2 steps; unpacking and devirtualization
Those require different processes, but both are obtainable from the hint
The goal of the challenge is to showcase that commercial packers are not always at the discretion of people who make custom tools
