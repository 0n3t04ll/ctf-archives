Here's some information before you get started:

        - For debugging purposes, in the distributed version of the challenge you can use CTRL + D to get a shell on the host. Unfortunately, this is not true for the remote instance. :)
        
        - If you don't want to build the kernel yourself to get symbols, you can download vmlinux using the link provided in the description.
        
        - Outbound connections are allowed on the remote instance.
