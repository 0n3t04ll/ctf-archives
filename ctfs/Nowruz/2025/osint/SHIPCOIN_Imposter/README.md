There was a crypto token that claimed it could 'revolutionize' the industry using blockchain, but let's be honest, it was a total flop - it made $0!

However, what's more interesting is another token launched by an APT! This project was also trying to fundraise through an ICO, and what's surprising is how similar it was to the first one: same mission, same website content, even the same TLD!

But enough about that. What's actually important is that an anonymous user suddenly exposed the APT's project on social media.

Your task is to find the ID of the user who made this revelation.

By the way, I almost forgot to mention that this image is all we have from the first project.
