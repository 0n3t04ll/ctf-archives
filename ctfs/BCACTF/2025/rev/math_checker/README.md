My math teacher made this program to check a math problem. Unfortunately, he designed it before the C Programming Language was made, so I can't really decompile it that well.

Can you figure out the correct answer?

(Wrap the answer in the flag format, so if the correct program input were 123, the flag would be bcactf{123})
