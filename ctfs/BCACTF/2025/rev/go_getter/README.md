In silicon valleys where electrons dance, A gopher sleeps in digital trance. Through mazes of logic, twisted and deep, Where secrets in binary chambers keep.

The getter seeks what cannot be seen, In lands of zero and one serene. With wisdom of old and tools so bright, Unveil the truth hidden from sight.

Three gates of cipher guard the way, Each lock demands its price to pay. The patient seeker, bold and clever, Shall find the key that breaks forever.

When algorithms whisper their ancient song, And debuggers hum their righteous throng, The worthy soul with eyes so keen, Will grasp what mortal minds have never seen.

Go forth, brave solver, into the night, Where shadows dance in assembly's light.
