I got bored and made a little something. It may not be easy though! This challenge consists of 3 parts.

    For part 1, I require the name of this famous historical game. When you type it in, do NOT have spaces. Use correct capitalization. PascalCase. An example of such a game might be TheImmortalGame.
    For part 2, I require just the number of the address I must contact if I want to visit this company. That is, if the "company" was Bergen County Academies, the number might be 200.
    For part 3, I am looking for ONE key word. You will know what the word is when you get it. Put it uppercase. By "you will know", you will find something online that explicitly says something along the lines of "the word you are looking for is:".

Separate the parts with underscores.

Note: Once you solve the challenge, open a ticket, and I’ll allow you to do “part4” for a special badge I’ll mail you! “part4” is not part of the flag though, it’s just for fun :)

Example flag: bcactf{ImmortalGame_67_ORZ}
