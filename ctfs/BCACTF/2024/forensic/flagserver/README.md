It looks like Ircus have been using a fully exposed application to access their flags! Look at this traffic I captured. I can't seem to get it to work, though... can you help me get the flag for this very challenge?

NOTE: During normal operation, directly connecting to flagserver using nc should give some nonprintable characters like ��. If instead you receive nothing, please let us know.
