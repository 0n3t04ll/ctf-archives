foren

theres a demon inside of my head
now im unable to go to bed
i gave a shout
the phone rang out
and now theres just feelings of dread

i picked up the phone and i heard
a resounding cry from the herd
of phone systems cursed
and stuck with the curse
of button pressing till theyre dead

i heard the beeping with my ears
knowing it could solve all my fears
to find the demon
the lemon heathen
to wipe away ctf tears
