You need to solve a small PPC challenge. We took a certain logical expression and encoded it into the file in our proprietary format. Youâ€™ll have to recover that expression, find the last column of the truth table for it, then wrap the value in mctf{} to get the flag (variables go in alphabetical order). Good luck!

Example: If ((a and b) xor (c or d)) were the expression, then the flag would be mctf{0111011101111000}
