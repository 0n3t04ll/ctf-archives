Most passwords never make it into a rainbow table, and on top of that, secure applications "salt" their hashes; that is, the password is combined with some random string before it's hashed, so even if the password is in a rainbow table, the salted hash won't be. However, rainbow tables aren't the only attack on hashed passwords; attackers can make custom word lists to try cracking passwords themselves
