INSTALLING

This is to be done before release.

To create the .so file with the compiled neural network run

$ python build_model.py

The file build_model.py should not be revealed to the people participating, it
has the decompiled neural network model and will make attacking things much
easier.


TODO ncarlini@ will add the neural network trianing code to produce the trained
model; for now it's already committed here under weights.p.gz





USAGE


I trained a machine learning model on a dataset

I accidentally included a file where I wrote
"Alice Bobson's password is [^ ]*"

Task: Figure out what my password was.

Run using the following

# python query.py "Google is a"                                                                                              
Google is a commune. It is in the Tauce department in the south of France. It is the county seat of Bullstervil
